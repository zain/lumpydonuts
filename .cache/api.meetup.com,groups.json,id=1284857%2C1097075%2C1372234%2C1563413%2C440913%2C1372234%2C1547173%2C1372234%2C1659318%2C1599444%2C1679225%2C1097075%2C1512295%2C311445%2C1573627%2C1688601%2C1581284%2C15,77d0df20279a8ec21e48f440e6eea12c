Even as an adult, I struggle with our unique family dynamic. I am sure there are many other siblings of special needs kids who share in my feelings of frustration, guilt, embarrassment and sadness. Perhaps some who have felt their emotional and or physical needs were overlooked by their parents who were overwhelmed by the more demanding needs of their sibling?  If you are an adult and have, or, had a sibling with disabilities, let's get together and start a little support group. We can share in the sadness and joy of having a family member that is constantly teaching us patience and reminding us to be thankful. Um... Also, laughing at and with our siblings, ourselves, and each other is part of being a family, and therefore I believe it should be a key element of the disabled siblings group.","name":"I'm Special Too!","members":"2","lat":"37.75","group_photo_count":"0","zip":"94110","lon":"-122.41999816894531","photo_url":"","group_urlname":"Im-Special-Too","organizer_name":"Ally Gill","short_link":"","country":"us","topics":[{"id":"2500","urlkey":"disability","name":"Living with Disabilities"},{"id":"20846","urlkey":"special-needs-children","name":"Special Needs Children"},{"id":"24192","urlkey":"family-and-friends-of-disabled-individuals","name":"Family and friends of disabled individuals"},{"id":"29632","urlkey":"sisterhood","name":"Sisterhood"},{"id":"35506","urlkey":"siblings","name":"siblings"},{"id":"36792","urlkey":"special-needs-families","name":"Special Needs Families"},{"id":"56645","urlkey":"plane-crazy","name":"Plane Crazy"}],"organizerProfileURL":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/members\/13172039\/","rating":"0.00","daysleft":""},{"visibility":"public","link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/braintrain\/","state":"CA","organizer_id":"10900273","join_mode":"1","city":"San Francisco","who":"Members","id":"1720530","created":"Mon Oct 11 20:49:38 EDT 2010","updated":"Fri Oct 22 20:18:42 EDT 2010","description":"Entertain, educate, and exchange ideas with business and technology users in the Bay Area.","name":"Brain Train","members":"11","lat":"37.790000915527344","group_photo_count":"0","zip":"94105","lon":"-122.4000015258789","photo_url":"","group_urlname":"braintrain","organizer_name":"Kenneth Lo, PMP","short_link":"","country":"us","topics":[{"id":"1824","urlkey":"webcms","name":"Web Content Management Systems"},{"id":"10209","urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology"},{"id":"10538","urlkey":"businessintell","name":"Business Intelligence"},{"id":"15401","urlkey":"social-media","name":"Social Media"},{"id":"17868","urlkey":"knowledge-management","name":"Knowledge Management"},{"id":"17940","urlkey":"content-management-systems","name":"Content Management Systems"},{"id":"26910","urlkey":"content-management","name":"Content Management"},{"id":"30927","urlkey":"data-warehouses","name":"Data Warehouses"},{"id":"31321","urlkey":"collaboration-and-knowledge-sharing","name":"Collaboration & Knowledge Sharing"},{"id":"37708","urlkey":"social-media-for-business","name":"Social Media for Business"},{"id":"49337","urlkey":"business-process-management","name":"Business Process Management"},{"id":"62223","urlkey":"sharepoint","name":"SharePoint"},{"id":"81871","urlkey":"business-process-improvement-consultant","name":"Business Process Improvement Consultant"}],"organizerProfileURL":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/members\/10900273\/","rating":"0.00","daysleft":""},{"visibility":"public","link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Lean-Startup-Dojo\/","state":"CA","organizer_id":"2852006","join_mode":"0","city":"San Francisco","who":"Members","id":"1720313","created":"Mon Oct 11 14:20:43 EDT 2010","updated":"Fri Oct 22 04:23:46 EDT 2010","description":"The Lean Startup Dojo is a weekly class focused on mastering the skills that you need to successfully build a Lean Startup.","name":"Lean Startup Dojo","members":"61","lat":"37.790000915527344","group_photo_count":"0","zip":"94108","lon":"-122.41000366210938","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/b\/5\/global_18668485.jpeg","group_urlname":"Lean-Startup-Dojo","organizer_name":"Rich Collins","short_link":"","country":"us","topics":[{"id":"38660","urlkey":"lean-startup","name":"Lean Startup"}],"organizerProfileURL":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/members\/2852006\/","rating":"0.00","daysleft":""},{"visibility":"public","link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SiliconLaunch-com\/","state":"CA","organizer_id":"11857143","join_mode":"0","city":"Mill Valley","who":"Entrepreneurs and Leaders","id":"1716244","created":"Sat Oct 02 22:45:50 EDT 2010","updated":"Sun Oct 24 15:59:12 EDT 2010","description":"Our purpose is to grow business, build leaders and bring together capital and the next Twitter, Google or Genetech..

My life is transforming before my eyes as I soften and open to living more fully. I invite you to come, play and see what opens in your life. Sincerely, Dana.\nIf you love to move, want to move more, or just know that movement could be your path to freedom and experiencing yourself more fully, we welcome you and support your process.\nPadma Gordon is a dancer, teacher and lover of life. She is committed to supporting others in living a fully embodied lifestyle by holding them in a safe container with her deeply grounded and loving presence. Padma's invitation is to connect to your vital energy and let it nourish and guide you. She gratefully lives this in her own daily life in Marin County, CA.\nCOME EXPERIENCE YOURSELF, During our time together you have opportunities to journey within and to let that journey dance. When you drop into your body and being deeply...into the level of subconscious receptivity you avail yourself to a particular kind of nourishment. And, when you couple this trance-like state with allowing the body to move naturally you may well find yourself shifting old patterns, letting go of limiting beliefs, feeling more present in your body and experiencing a sense of blissful relaxation. The more nourished and balanced you feel the more you have to give...\nPlease come and bring your friends, family and circle of healers...\nI look forward to supporting you.\nWith blessings for your life,\nPadma.\nThis will be our second gathering and we plan to meet every 4-6 weeks for 2 hours. The price will be $35 and plan to wear something comfortable and easy to move in and keep in mind we will get warm as we \"move into our selves\". Eat lightly before and be well hydrated (we have lot's of water at the center too).\nSee you soon,  Dana, Synergy Mind Body Wellness www.synergymindbodywellness.com","name":"Synergy-Aliveness in Motion","members":"10","lat":"37.779998779296875","group_photo_count":"0","zip":"94118","lon":"-122.45999908447266","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/a\/4\/global_18286516.jpeg","group_urlname":"synergyinmotion","organizer_name":"Dana Sanchez","short_link":"","country":"us","topics":[{"id":"8702","urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation"},{"id":"16144","urlkey":"self-empowerment-exploration","name":"Self Empowerment & Exploration"},{"id":"21136","urlkey":"spirituality-personal-growth-meditation","name":"Spirituality, Personal Growth, Meditation"},{"id":"33457","urlkey":"sacred-dance","name":"Sacred Dance"},{"id":"34160","urlkey":"dance-and-movement","name":"Dance and Movement"},{"id":"54442","urlkey":"circle-dancers","name":"Circle Dancers"}],"organizerProfileURL":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/members\/10215356\/","rating":"0.00","daysleft":""},{"visibility":"public","link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SF-Bestseller-Book-Club\/","state":"CA","organizer_id":"9710035","join_mode":"0","city":"San Francisco","who":"Book Lovers","id":"1709944","created":"Mon Sep 20 15:43:13 EDT 2010","updated":"Wed Oct 20 21:36:54 EDT 2010","description":"I'm looking to organize a group that's interested in reading the books that are on the top of the NY Times Fiction best seller list and meeting in downtown San Francisco monthly to discuss the book.","name":"SF Bestseller Book Club","members":"30","lat":"37.77000045776367","group_photo_count":"0","zip":"94103","lon":"-122.41000366210938","photo_url":"","group_urlname":"SF-Bestseller-Book-Club","organizer_name":"Michael Bradley","short_link":"","country":"us","topics":[{"id":"2767","urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club"}],"organizerProfileURL":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/members\/9710035\/","rating":"0.00","daysleft":""},{"visibility":"public","link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/TRX-Street-TeamSF\/","state":"CA","organizer_id":"12476675","join_mode":"0","city":"San Francisco","who":"TRX'ers","id":"1707372","created":"Wed Sep 15 14:00:25 EDT 2010","updated":"Mon Oct 11 11:42:04 EDT 2010","description":"The most versatile full-body workout that can be done anywhere.

I would like to help anyone interested get into better shape for a very low cost.  The group will go over all your fitness needs from diet and cardiovascular strength, functional weight and body weight training to mental attitude.  Sessions will start nice and simple and progress to more difficult movements over time.  Different themes will be focused on each meeting and we will rotate to keep things fresh and the body guessing.

This group is for single, 40ish-50ish men and women, who want to dine with smart, interesting people at the Bay Area&rsquo;s top, yet affordable restaurants. I&rsquo;m talking about restaurants with entrees that are typically $15-$25, and have more stars than dollar signs in their ratings. My &ldquo;frugal radar&rdquo; will be on the lookout for pre-fixe menus, mid-week and manager specials, and other discounts to stretch the dining dollar as far as it will go. There will be a nominal charge for some events to cover running the site and organizing events.\r\nSo how things work in this Meetup group&hellip; since I think that small groups at tables of 6-8 are best for really getting good conversation (and to share bottles of wine) at dinner, most events will have a minimum of two, and a maximum of three, tables reserved at the restaurant. When one table fills up there will be a waiting list for a second or third table. When enough people sign up for an additional table, those waiting will be confirmed. To eliminate the &ldquo;flake factor&rdquo;, at times there is a reservation fee of $5 ($4 of which is applied to your meal and $1 is an event fee) to hold your place. If you cancel less than 24 hours from the event, or don&rsquo;t show at all&hellip;your money (the entire $5) will not be returned and appetizers may be on you!\r\nThere are at least two Meetups a month. Typically, one will be on the &ldquo;higher&rdquo; end of the group&rsquo;s price range and one will be on the lower end. For starters I am using SF Chronicle&rsquo;s top 100 restaurants and Bargain Bites, Frommer&rsquo;s, Zagat, and &ldquo;Check Please&rdquo; for recommendations for restaurants that meet the price criteria.\r\nIn the future, I will take suggestions for restaurants, but along with a name, you need to send me some type of critical review to support your choice, and more importantly, to have participated in a few meet ups.\r\nI think this group offers a unique opportunity for interesting people to eat at interesting places. Hope to see you there!\r\nErica","name":"Frugal Foodies-Bay Area Dining on a Budget","members":"150","lat":"37.61000061035156","group_photo_count":"0","zip":"94128","lon":"-122.38999938964844","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/6\/b\/7\/global_15701815.jpeg","group_urlname":"Frugal-Foodies","organizer_name":"Erica","short_link":"","country":"us","topics":[{"id":"713","urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out"},{"id":"2190","urlkey":"bargainhunters","name":"Bargain Hunters"},{"id":"16011","urlkey":"food-lovers","name":"Food Lovers"},{"id":"17866","urlkey":"meeting-new-people","name":"Meeting New People"},{"id":"38306","urlkey":"single-professionals-looking-to-meet-other-singles","name":"Single Professionals looking to Meet other Singles"},{"id":"48555","urlkey":"new-in-town","name":"New in Town"},{"id":"74550","urlkey":"foodies-over-40","name":"Foodies Over 40"}],"organizerProfileURL":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/members\/7679724\/","rating":"4.69","daysleft":""},{"visibility":"public","link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/FIERI-San-Francisco\/","state":"CA","organizer_id":"12152651","join_mode":"0","city":"San Francisco","who":"Members","id":"1657696","created":"Mon Jun 07 22:16:08 EDT 2010","updated":"Fri Oct 01 05:53:57 EDT 2010","description":"Ciao!

Fate threw me suited up into an office for seven years. This was my tour of duty in the illusory world of hierarchical control, greed, fear and systemic hypnosis.  I was living a half-life, and no-one was more aware of this fact than I was. There were, of course, moments of stunning humanity in my time in &ldquo;the office&rdquo; working as a financial adviser and all round salesman for the corporate control grid. I met people who inspired me, people who helped propel me out of the locked way of thinking that a big corporation (in my case HBOS PLC) demands of the minds in attendance. But still I remained a slave, wearing my tie as I woke up before dawn to go and sell investments to unsuspecting people.\r\nBut fate had different ideas in store for little Charlie. The economic controlled demolition of the world monetary system had me out on the street by the 1st May 2009, jobless. Suddenly I was able to do what I wanted to do, and the destiny I was too scared to enact for myself was thrust upon me, a truly humbling experience &ndash; because without losing my job would I be where I am today, megaphone and camera in hand shining a light up the asshole of evil, seeing what it is made of? Who knows&hellip;\r\nI bought a camera because I&rsquo;d had a few experiences where I was spiritually inspired by people in the real world and I thought &ldquo;If I can do the same for my fellow people, then I want to share with them the best way I know&hellip;&rdquo;, and the spiritual videos were born. We can call them spiritual, we can call them humanistic, we can call them political, some may even call them comedy, though they are not always funny. What I have managed to always be in my work is honest, as dictated by my own beliefs that nothing should be hidden. If I make mistakes, I know that the people will forgive me, as I have to forgive myself. But I hope I can bring my own special method of waking people up to those who need it the most &ndash; those, who like I used to be, are trapped in the corporate matrix AND think it is real; those who believe working greedily in an office whilst children die like dogs in Africa is the pinnacle of human evolution. No, none of us think the world is the pinnacle of the way things could be, but we are too scared to change ourselves and the world. The many temptations of money, respect and authority are always with us&hellip;until now. You can almost taste the electricity in the air with people waking up and simply not being a part of the consumerist-mediocrity that we hold up. We can now speak to people about conspiracy theories, about spiritual matters, about the esoteric&hellip;and we are understood.\r\nEven my father, a conservative-hawk who watches Sky News and has old fashioned views supporting the Empire, now sees that September 11th was not as explained. I wasn&rsquo;t there, and most probably you, the reader, were not there in Manhattan that day, but like the Swine Flu scare, we have no reason to trust the lies of the governments when we can see with our own eyes a building demolished and blown to pyroclastic smithereens&hellip;\r\nI search for the truth. It exists inside me somewhere, and the more work I do for the greater spiritual awakening of all, the more the universe\/the source\/the absolute cares for me and gently nudges me towards my true path. Again, I  feel small than when I contemplate the Absolute Consciousness, but though I feel small, I never feel alone, I never feel unloved, I never feel misunderstood. This is what I want to share with you; the power of working towards losing ego and trusting that Everything is OK&hellip;if only we could make it so.\r\nThe work that myself and my friends do is purely to inspire you to look within yourself and realise that there is nothing to be scared of. Do not follow us, do not think of us as leaders, do not emulate us, for we are imperfect fools searching as much as you are. The work we do out on the streets is to bring the message of peace and unity to the people who need to hear it most. By holding our ground against the uniformed\/costumed Police officers and security that try and tell us how to act, we show a microcosm of the big issues we all face. Think of your fears in a bullet-proof, flourescent jacket, holding a pair of handcuffs. Learn how to stand up for the inviolability of your own soul.  I promise you brothers and sisters that there is nothing they can do to you once you realise you are a spirit having a temporary human experience; that you hold all of the secrets of the universe inside your heart, and that you will never die. YOU WILL NEVER DIE. You will live on forever and you are infinitely loved. I cannot tell you this, but you will feel this for yourself soon. This I promise. We all used to think like this, but many of us have forgotten. The glory of remembering is for us all to take.\r\nWith so much love and affection which words cannot do justice to,\r\nCharlie","name":"Love Police \/ Everything is OK San Francisco","members":"21","lat":"37.77000045776367","group_photo_count":"0","zip":"94117","lon":"-122.44000244140625","photo_url":"","group_urlname":"LovePolice","organizer_name":"Unconditional Love","short_link":"","country":"us","topics":[{"id":"91","urlkey":"globalization","name":"Anti-Globalization"},{"id":"264","urlkey":"friends","name":"Friends"},{"id":"2252","urlkey":"actforlove","name":"Act For Love"},{"id":"3277","urlkey":"9-11","name":"9\/11 Questions"},{"id":"4377","urlkey":"politics","name":"Politics & Activism"},{"id":"7040","urlkey":"constitutionalist","name":"Constitutionalist"},{"id":"15013","urlkey":"end-the-fed","name":"End The Fed"},{"id":"15695","urlkey":"we-are-change","name":"We Are Change"},{"id":"16240","urlkey":"liberty","name":"Liberty"},{"id":"16564","urlkey":"anti-new-world-order","name":"Anti-New World Order"},{"id":"18432","urlkey":"freedom","name":"Freedom"},{"id":"19616","urlkey":"infowar-activists","name":"InfoWar Activists"},{"id":"23245","urlkey":"restoring-the-u-s-constitution-in-government","name":"Restoring the U S Constitution in Government"},{"id":"29592","urlkey":"9-11-truth","name":"9\/11 Truth"},{"id":"85841","urlkey":"take-action-against-gmos","name":"Take Action Against GMO's"}],"organizerProfileURL":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/members\/10781691\/","rating":"5.00","daysleft":""},{"visibility":"public","link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LiveMusicSF\/","state":"CA","organizer_id":"9732581","join_mode":"0","city":"San Francisco","who":"Music Lovers","id":"1625447","created":"Sun Apr 04 20:37:59 EDT 2010","updated":"Sat Oct 23 19:21:41 EDT 2010","description":"This is a meetup group where music fans can meet and get together with other like-minded music lovers.

We are warriors of wisdom and sorcerers of soul.  We are Beautiful.\nYet, for one reason or another, we fall out of connection to this source that we are.  We lose touch with our ground of being, our truth, our power, our light, and we wander as disconnected and lost victims of life.  Until through grace we remember and reawaken...\nThis is a group of sincere beings remembering and reawakening to our true, powerful, and tender selves.  There are uncountable methods for awakening, and in this group, we focus on Chakra Trance Dance.\nChakra Trance Dance is a form of dynamic meditation, developed by the Master Raja Yogis of the Mongolian Himalayas (Altay).  It involves a guided journey of conscious free movement through the vital energetic centers of the body- Chakras- in order to awaken and balance these powerful and transformative energies.  This technique is ancient and shamanic in its origins, yet its form has been reiterated by contemporary spiritual masters for the minds, bodies, hearts, and conditions of the 21st century human.\nSessions begin with a brief introduction to the 7 major chakras.  Then, we draw our circle, creating a safe and open space to be with ourselves freely; this includes creating a small altar to hold our intentions and our center.  Then, we dance.  Being led on a journey through the chakras, we dance to modern trance music, along with ambient and special mystical music created by Shamanic Masters from Altai (Northern Himalayas).  We close with a deep relaxation and a sharing.  The whole journey takes place in our safe and supportive practice space at Yoga Society.\nThrough Trance Dance, we join together; not simply as a group of dancers, but as a crystallized field of empowerment.  Through our guided dance, we generate a unified field of love and light, functioning to attract more of the same into our lives.\nAs we dance we awaken to and steady our connection with our essential Self: Being, Consciousness, Love.  We cleanse physical toxins and repressed emotions...liberating anxiety and stress.  We actively create inner-vitality and brightness, physical strength and exuberance, and increased personal power (which supports self-esteem, healthy relationships, success in business, and the energy to discover and realize our Essential Purpose).  In short, we bring forth that which we are and always have been.\nPlease understand that there is no need for a spiritual practice or background, or training in dance.\nSo come! Join our community of Divine Dancers and remember and manifest what you truly are!

We encourage all developers, providers and consumers of open APIs to gather and discuss innovations, opportunities and tactical or strategic problems faced.\r\nWe've seen a lot of conversation and change going on in the API space, driven by cloud computing, SaaS, open source and other disruptions, and would like to get the community together to see how we can work together and come up with ideas on how to make IT, business and development better by managing and harnessing the power of open APIs. Private APIs are a part of today's technology mix as well, so we also invite discussion of open vs. private approaches and how to best enable them to work together.\r\nTopics to address include:\r\n* Design  * Documentation  * Managing multiple APIs  * Working with cloud APIs  * Supporting developer communities  * API standards and interoperability  * Security\/managing access and permissions with APIs  * What makes a good API (or a bad one)  * Enterprise adoption  * Tools, PaaS and vendors in the API economy  * Other ideas welcome!!\r\nSince it has become such a hot topic, this first meetup will focus around cloud APIs, how cloud computing impacts the way we use APIs and what we can do to make working with them easier and more productive.

These understandings and practices transcend and unite all wisdom traditions, harmonizing science and spirit.\nSpecifically, we practice the arts of Aharata (Way of the Warrior\/Psychological Aikido), Chakra Trance Dance (dynamic meditation to awaken and vitalize the body), and Workshops on many aspects of Integral Health and Empowerment (especially in Raja Yoga and Shamanic Traditions).  We also host 'Spiritual Socials'- a place and time to celebrate and relax with good food and good people, often with a special event.\nSo come and join our community of sincere practitioners, seeking to open our hearts, awaken our minds, heal our bodies, empower our lives, and fully honor this mysterious human experience.\nBlessings, Aho, Namaste, Aloha, Amin, Shalom, Sadhu, Asalam Alaykum.","name":"SF Empowered Journey Practice Community","members":"84","lat":"37.779998779296875","group_photo_count":"0","zip":"94115","lon":"-122.44000244140625","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/2\/e\/global_13633582.jpeg","group_urlname":"EmpoweredJourney","organizer_name":"Eka Joti","short_link":"","country":"us","topics":[{"id":"774","urlkey":"metaphysics","name":"Metaphysics"},{"id":"1254","urlkey":"shamanism","name":"Shamanism"},{"id":"2872","urlkey":"lifecoaching","name":"Lifestyle Coaching"},{"id":"3382","urlkey":"lawofattraction","name":"Law of Attraction"},{"id":"4417","urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness"},{"id":"8702","urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation"},{"id":"16144","urlkey":"self-empowerment-exploration","name":"Self Empowerment & Exploration"},{"id":"26307","urlkey":"insight-meditation","name":"Insight Meditation"},{"id":"26985","urlkey":"integral-spirituality","name":"Integral Spirituality"},{"id":"61158","urlkey":"hatha-yoga-kundalini-yoga","name":"Hatha Yoga & Kundalini Yoga"},{"id":"70577","urlkey":"mindfulness-meditation","name":"Mindfulness Meditation"},{"id":"72960","urlkey":"raja-yoga","name":"Raja Yoga"},{"id":"72961","urlkey":"integral-health","name":"Integral Health"},{"id":"72962","urlkey":"aharata","name":"Aharata"},{"id":"72963","urlkey":"planetary-healing-meditation","name":"Planetary Healing Meditation"}],"organizerProfileURL":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/members\/8867004\/","rating":"4.90","daysleft":""},{"visibility":"public","link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/sfbayoneness\/","state":"CA","organizer_id":"11190904","join_mode":"0","city":"San Francisco","who":"Members","id":"1581284","created":"Tue Jan 12 11:47:16 EST 2010","updated":"Mon Oct 18 13:44:50 EDT 2010","description":"We organize regular Oneness Blessing events in\/around the SF Bay Area.\r\nThe Oneness Blessing is a non-denominational experience that transfers physical energy, awakening our connection with the oneness in everything, allowing each of us to deepen our relationship with those we love, with ourselves, with strangers and with our creator.\r\nThe Oneness Blessing initiates a neurobiological change in the brain. There are 16 centers in the brain responsible for definitive experiences like sensory perception, emotions of jealousy, hatred, fear, compassion, love, joy, separation, connectedness, creativity, learning, etc. The Oneness Blessing results in the activation of certain centers and the de-activation of certain other centers thus bringing about a shift in the perception and experience of life.\r\nThe Oneness Blessing is also found to help in the healing of the body and in the discharge of repetitive emotional patterns, resulting in greater ease and comfort with oneself.\r\nIn relationships it enables a greater sensitivity and connectedness with the other, freeing you from the limitations of your judgments and conditionings.\r\nSuccess and prosperity begins with consciousness &ndash; a capacity to expand your horizon of thinking and an understanding of the universe around you, the principles governing you.\r\nThe Oneness Blessing results in a growth in consciousness. It is the phenomenon behind the work of Oneness. It is an act of energy transfer by touch or by the power of intent.\r\nIt has often been said that if you take one step towards God, then God will take a hundred steps towards you.

There's nothing quite like getting together in a room and having a full band playing together, most importantly having fun while rocking out to your favorite songs. We can also go to any public events that have Rock Band\/Guitar Hero nights.\r\nThis is first and foremost meant to be a social group that is purely for the joy of having fun while rocking out. It's also meant to be an ALL SKILL LEVEL group, from those who like to play on No Fail Mode all the way to Expert rockers that can hit every hammer-on and pull-off. Even if you don't own the game or you've never played and really want to, this a perfect place to meet others who will show you want to do. Don't let your skill level hold you back. Of course, if the opportunity is there for a bunch of experienced rockers to get together certain times and have some friendly competitions, that could definitely happen, but again, we want all skills to come together and rock out.\r\nSo besides having a love to play Rock Band\/Guitar Hero, it would also be awesome if various people could host meetups, though not a requirement to join, but it would be great to be able to have meetups at several places. I could definitely host from time to time, but it might be limited to certain times or too far of distance for some people to attend. Having several people around the Bay Area who could host would allow for more opportunities to have meetups. All you would need to have to host is a full band setup of any of the Rock Band or Guitar Hero games and a space to play, we'll provide the people. Another advantage to this is the experience of playing a different version of one of the games or downloaded songs you've never played that others might have.\r\nWith all that said, let's get to rockin! Please contact me if you would like to help out and be an assistant organizer and\/or are willing to host meetups.","name":"Bay Area Rock Band\/Guitar Hero Rockers","members":"40","lat":"37.79999923706055","group_photo_count":"0","zip":"94602","lon":"-122.20999908447266","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/e\/3\/global_16101811.jpeg","group_urlname":"Bay-Area-RB-GH-Rockers","organizer_name":"Rachel","short_link":"","country":"us","topics":[{"id":"4471","urlkey":"videogame","name":"Video Games"},{"id":"15018","urlkey":"music","name":"Music"},{"id":"17030","urlkey":"make-new-friends","name":"Make New Friends"},{"id":"17136","urlkey":"guitar-hero-tournament","name":"Guitar Hero Tournament"},{"id":"18071","urlkey":"gaming","name":"Gaming"},{"id":"39605","urlkey":"rock-band-tournament","name":"Rock Band Tournament"}],"organizerProfileURL":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/members\/8871940\/","rating":"4.92","daysleft":""},{"visibility":"public","link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SwingFestivalDanceDiscounts\/","state":"CA","organizer_id":"9458708","join_mode":"0","city":"San Francisco","who":"Members","id":"1553527","created":"Sun Nov 08 09:56:30 EST 2009","updated":"Sun Oct 24 15:16:02 EDT 2010","description":"TO PURCHASE TICKETS SCROLL DOWN TO CALENDAR PER NIGHT RSVP!\r\nParty at our 6th SWING FESTIVAL December 2010 in SF under the Pyramid at China Town\r\nHilton-financial district\r\nDISCOUNTS FOR DANCES FOR DANCERS & NEW DANCER FRIENDS...\r\n2 day workshops in Lindy Hop & of course Balboa! 3 night workshops in Lindy, Blues, Shag, 20's Charleston and of course Balboa! 3 nights of dancing with North American Open Championships in all the dances listed above!\r\nMore info at http:\/\/www.SwingChampionships.com\r\nWaiver and Release: By RSVPing or registering you agree to the following: Liability Waiver: Liability Waiver I agree to forgo, & expressly waive, any damage rights I or my heirs may have against San Francisco Balboa Festival, QDBA or its agents, contractors, employees or volunteers for any & all injury and damages I may suffer by participating in the workshop or dances at any location during the San Francisco Balboa Festival, held December 3-6, 2010.

We'll be reading from the two most recent books by Esther and Jerry Hicks -- The Vortex & Money and the Law of Attraction -- as well as listening to powerful selections from the recordings of their Law of Attraction workshops. (The recorded workshops are led by Abraham, a group of nonphysical entities brought through Esther to provide these teachings from their nonphysical perspective.) Our discussions of these materials will emphasize the importance of telling the story that we want to be living, focusing on what feels good, and continually looking for things to praise and appreciate.\r\n\r\nThe Celebrate Life Community hosts our weekly discussion, which meets every Monday from 7:30 to 9 p.m. at the Celebration Center, 4530 18th St, San Francisco. (Cross street: Ord)  If coming by car, allow ample time for parking. By Muni, the 33-Stanyan stops within a block of the Center, and the K, L, M & T lines stop a few blocks away at Castro Street Station.\r\n\r\nOur suggested donation is $10,----but be here no  matter your budget! The abundance will follow.\r\n\r\nYour RSVP is not needed but strongly encouraged as we have a limitedseating---AND your rsvp encourages others to attend that want to be together!!  Questions? Feel free to e-mail Jacquie or Drew.  And if you feel you would benefit from taking notes at our gatherings, you're certainly welcome to do so.\r\n\r\nIf you're new to the Abraham teachings, the book that I highly recommend is called Ask and It Is Given, which is also by Esther and Jerry Hicks.  More immediate exposure to these teachings can be found on YouTube by running a search on Abraham-Hicks, as well as on Abraham-Hicks.com.\r\n\r\nHope you'll join us soon!","name":"SF Law of Attraction \/ Teachings of Abraham Study Group","members":"48","lat":"37.7599983215332","group_photo_count":"0","zip":"94114","lon":"-122.44000244140625","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/4\/e\/7\/global_11597351.jpeg","group_urlname":"Abraham-Hicks-SF","organizer_name":"Celebrate Life","short_link":"","country":"us","topics":[{"id":"2756","urlkey":"abrahamhicks","name":"Abraham Hicks"},{"id":"3382","urlkey":"lawofattraction","name":"Law of Attraction"}],"organizerProfileURL":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/members\/11320055\/","rating":"4.01","daysleft":""},{"visibility":"public","link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/apocalypse\/","state":"CA","organizer_id":"10032602","join_mode":"0","city":"San Francisco","who":"Survivors","id":"1547173","created":"Mon Oct 26 23:52:18 EDT 2009","updated":"Sat Oct 23 06:15:48 EDT 2010","description":"Meet other apocalypse sci fi lovers over drinks at various cozy bars in the city!

We're already in Berkely\/Oakland\/Alameda but want to expand into your neighborhood. We're setting up an introductory program for women to see if there is enough interest in an ongoing program to bring us to Walnut Creek on a weekly basis. The program is for novice or intermediate abilites including fit walkers through competent runners.\r\nAs coach and founder of Go WOW Team - Fit Women of the World, my goal is to promote lifetime fitness for all adult women, using the outdoors as our venue and walking or running (or a combination of both) as the method of movement.\r\nIf successful, with enough participants, in this introductory program, we want the group to be ongoing with regular workouts every weekend and during the week. This is what we already do in the inner East Bay and in SF. Come on out and participate!\r\nSpeed is secondary in our training! We accommodate many levels and encourage everyone to participate. If you are a fit walker, all the way through being an experienced runner, WOW wants you! Pace is not the issue, time on your feet is what counts. If you can handle 60 minutes of continuous movement (at any pace), you will find a supportive group that can help you reach your individual, unique fitness goals.\r\nWOW believes that all women can set fitness goals and reach them. As a coach, I believe that any of you who start training with us soon will be able to complete a race (if this is one of your goals) and have a great experience. Training starts soon but you can join any time. Just talk with me. Contact me at CoachStephanie@gowowteam.com\r\nI want to meet you and go over the details. You should be a member of WOW - Fit Women of the World. Now's the time! Contact us soon!\r\nTo Fitness!

The best way to enhance your job prospects is by expanding your network and the search strategies you use. The mission of San Francisco Professional Career Network (SFPCN) is to help you build upon each of these by assembling professionals from a broad range of industries and providing a forum where you can learn, share your experiences, announce your goals and needs, and find new job search strategies. Programs are arranged in three formats: \r\n \r\n\r\n1)    Intimate, roundtable networking: We circle through the group one at a time, with each person sharing a thumbnail of our professional experience and the types of positions we are seeking. This is a great way for everyone to get to know one another and leads to a natural flow of conversation between those who connect in some way. Its always fun and productive, and the interaction will keep your communications skills sharp!\r\n\r\n2)    Program speakers: SFPCN presents vibrant program speakers that will add to your business knowledge and job searching tool kit. Recent programs have included Find Success Through Following Your Passion, by nationally acclaimed author and life coach Nancy Anderson, Three Pillars of a Successful Job Search, by Checkster.com CEO Yves Lermusi, and Propel Your Job Search: Let Your Brilliance Shine in Social Media, by renowned Social Media Consultant Carlos Hernandez. Presentations generally run from 30 to 60 minutes, followed by a Q & A session.\r\n\r\n3)    Pure Networking: Our Pure Networking opportunities are evening gatherings, providing an opportunity for members to get to know one another in an informal, relaxed environment. We share ideas, strategies, stories, and enjoy ourselves. Its a great opportunity to join in for those who find an evening get together more convenient. The better we know one another, the more we can help one another.\r\n\r\nOur Group is friendly, dynamic, and receptive, and can be a real catalyst in propelling your job search.

Each month a new ingredient will be presented, and all participants will bake their interpretation of the ingredient in cupcake fashion. All bakers will meetup on the last Monday of each month where the live challenge will begin. Friends, family, and other contestants will take part in the taste testing as well as voting for the winner. By the end of the evening a winner will be chosen and random prizes will be awarded to the winner. The goal is to gather as many cupcake lovers as possible together to expand their cupcakes horizons, their baking skills, and ultimately have a great time.

Meet weekdays and weekends to walk or run 3 miles or more at various locations throughout the Bay Area. Our group is social but fitness is our goal. Minimum requirement is that you can move for 60 minutes already. The pace doesn't matter.\nSome of us walk for fitness. Some of us mix walking\/running. Some of us are pretty serious runners and are training to improve our times. Most of us participate in a race once in a while. I encourage women to compete in a few events every year and I help them train. Setting goals and following through makes a big difference in sticking with a fitness plan however, racing is not a requirement to join us.\n\nMembers include: Walkers who can walk for at least 60 minutes, steady - want to maintain or improve general fitness; maybe lose some weight. You don't have to move fast but you have to have the stamina to be on your feet for this long or you won't have much fun with us.\nRecreational Runners and Runner\/Walkers - 10-15 min\/mile - sometimes compete. These women are competing with themselves to improve their fitness, lose weight, and race to stay focused. Many comment on the stress relief from their busy lives, too. We have many women who are in this category.\nRunners or fast runner\/walkers 8 - 12 min\/miles, compete often. Are truly into competing, training for events and placing well in their age divisions or striving to qualify for a goal like The Boston Marathon.\nAll ages, all abilities welcome and you may drop-in any time. The WOW Team is a club that offers workouts every week of the year. Currently 5 workouts a week throughout the Bay Area including SF, Oakland, Berkeley, the Peninsula, Alameda, Walnut Creek and more. Come on out! Drop-ins are always welcome.\nThe WOW Team was founded by certified personal trainer, nutrition consultant and running coach Stephanie Atwood. All coached workouts have a fee.\nIf you are a member and would like to add additional workouts in your neighborhood, please contact Coach Stephanie. The WOW Team long range mission is to offer neighborhood workouts with local leaders throughout the USA and eventually, the entire globe.\n\"When we're moving we're getting fit. Where we stop, nobody knows! The sky's the limit!\"\nAlso keep in mind that women can participate in any or all groups throughout the Bay Area.

The book outlines a 12-week series of exercises to promote your creativity, of whatever flavor it might be, and to help you over whatever bumps you might be having with it. We add to the book by meeting in small groups to go through the sequence together, to congratulate each other on work accomplished, to commiserate on work not accomplished, to nudge each other a little from day to day, and to generally give support to whatever&rsquo;s happening with your creative work.\r\nThe purpose of the Meetup as a whole is to organize these small groups. About one new group a month is created; group-creation happens whenever we have enough new people in a given area. So far most of the groups have been in Oakland\/Berkeley, with a few in San Francisco, and one in the Peninsula. We do have some scattered interest out in Contra Costa and up in Marin; hoping to get quorums there still. Occasionally people join into existing groups. We are also talking about organizing some \"graduate\" groups, where people go on beyond the Artist's Way.\r\nIn this Artist's Way Meetup we have no professional facilitators and there is no charge at all for participating; our study groups are all purely self-organized and self-directed.\r\nThere were a few \"fee\" events or groups in the past (and probably be will be in the future) led by professional artists, but those were and will always be clearly identified as \"paid\" group events.\r\nPlease post your ideas & encouragements freely to the whole group; and in general your help with doing the organizing would be very welcome.\r\nMore details at http:\/\/artistsway.meetup.com\/220\/about.","name":"Bay Area Creativity - Artist's Way","members":"262","lat":"37.81999969482422","group_photo_count":"0","zip":"94130","lon":"-122.37000274658203","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/7\/4\/5\/global_10913957.jpeg","group_urlname":"BayAreaArtistsWay","organizer_name":"Linda in San Mateo","short_link":"","country":"us","topics":[{"id":"264","urlkey":"friends","name":"Friends"},{"id":"772","urlkey":"writers","name":"Writers"},{"id":"924","urlkey":"artistsway","name":"The Artist's Way"},{"id":"1502","urlkey":"art","name":"Art"},{"id":"10447","urlkey":"creativecircle","name":"Creative Circle"},{"id":"27822","urlkey":"art-creativity","name":"Art & Creativity"},{"id":"119627","urlkey":"personal-growth-through-art","name":"Personal Growth through Art"}],"organizerProfileURL":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/members\/9588620\/","rating":"4.69","daysleft":""},{"visibility":"public","link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/latinbayarea\/","state":"CA","organizer_id":"4397871","join_mode":"0","city":"San Francisco","who":"Bay Area Salsa Lovers","id":"607567","created":"Tue Aug 07 12:02:23 EDT 2007","updated":"Sat Oct 23 11:43:14 EDT 2010","description":"Join us for all of our Meetup activities in the SF Bay Area and even the remottest part of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe Bay Area Nightlife Meetup is the perfect way to meet new friends in a fun, sexy and non-intimidating atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWhat you should expect:\r\n\r\nParties, After-parties, After-party breakfast, Dance Classes and Workshops for the Absolute beginners!

We are a member-driven group with everyone pitching in to organize, greet new members and socialize. Here are some monthly events you can expect:\r\n\r\nRACHEL'S REGULAR MEGA MEETUP: Every month you can expect a regular meetup organized by Rachel either at Level III or Hotel Rex. This meetup is large, but held at a quiet location that promotes mingling and conversation.\r\n\r\nJR'S \"FIRST FRIDAY FIESTA\": This is popular monthly meetup with a lively atmosphere and more of a 'party' feel to it. People come to celebrate the end of the work week, mingle in Spanish in an upbeat and fun atmosphere.\r\n\r\nSAUL'S SELECTION: Once a month assistant organizer, Saul, picks a new (or old) place for a mid-week meetup. He mixes things up so our group gets to try new locations. The atmosphere tends to be that of a lively party, with music and people hanging out until later.\r\n\r\nWEEKEND DAY MEETUPS: On selected Saturdays you have a chance to sit down and practice Spanish in a smaller group setting. These meetups offer the perfect atmosphere to practice Spanish and sip coffee or even a glass of wine depending on the venue.\r\n\r\nSPANISH WORKSHOPS: Once or twice a month workshops are held at ABC Language School (www.abclanguagesf.com) to promote language learning and help learners of all levels. These workshops are a good way to meet other members before getting into the mix of a regular meetup.\r\n\r\nRULES OF MINGLING: As a member of our group you have some duties as well. There is no hand holding or personal assistant to guide you in and show you how to integrate. That is your job. You MUST walk in and approach someone (anyone!) introduce yourself in Spanish and start the conversation. If you are already mingling, you MUST greet anyone new and integrate them into your conversation. Once more than 15 people arrive at any given meetup, mingling is out of the organizer's control and is in your hands. This is not a place to be shy; pluck up your courage and mingle. If you really can't see yourself integrating on your own, come to a workshop to meet other members first, or go to a smaller meetups when offered where the organizer has more control.\r\n\r\nWHAT SPANISH LEVEL TO EXPECT: Native speakers of Spanish are common in the group, others are intermediate to advanced speakers. All levels welcome, but please understand that if you are at a beginning level, you may feel frustrated by the pace of interactions.  If you are a total beginner, finish that class youre taking and join us when you think youre ready.  Once you get past the total beginner level, take a workshop or two with us and youll feel even more confident.\r\n\r\nWHAT ATMOSPHERE TO EXPECT: Lively, social, fun! If you are sensitive to noise, you should choose one of the mellower meetups (outlined above). If you prefer mingling with a variety of people, choose a livelier meetup where you are on your feet and moving around. Read the descriptions above to know which meetup is right for you. Prefer a meetup in a home or with someone greeting people and handing out name tags? Let me know when we can come to your house, or when you are available to volunteer to be the meetup greeter. We love all the help we can get.","name":"San Francisco Spanish-Language MeetUp","members":"2231","lat":"37.790000915527344","group_photo_count":"0","zip":"94109","lon":"-122.41999816894531","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/c\/global_13020284.jpeg","group_urlname":"Spanish-Language-Meetup","organizer_name":"Rachel","short_link":"","country":"us","topics":[{"id":"183","urlkey":"spanish","name":"Spanish Language"}],"organizerProfileURL":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/members\/810537\/","rating":"4.37","daysleft":""}],"meta":{"lon":"","count":116,"link":"https:\/\/api.meetup.com\/groups.json","next":"","total_count":116,"url":"https:\/\/api.meetup.com\/groups.json?key=786e7745f52527d5f5b14783949&radius=25.0&order=ctime&offset=0&format=json&id=1284857%2C1097075%2C1372234%2C1563413%2C440913%2C1372234%2C1547173%2C1372234%2C1659318%2C1599444%2C1679225%2C1097075%2C1512295%2C311445%2C1573627%2C1688601%2C1581284%2C1553527%2C737108%2C321601%2C1707372%2C1097075%2C1271344%2C1470195%2C1624545%2C1306093%2C1627081%2C1600425%2C1174738%2C1583570%2C1703622%2C1065226%2C1668002%2C1065714%2C1625447%2C343999%2C1720662%2C1439978%2C1631617%2C1372234%2C1550136%2C1550136%2C1678569%2C1627630%2C1406489%2C440913%2C1503645%2C1720313%2C1669064%2C529523%2C1097075%2C1716244%2C1621324%2C1720530%2C1721416%2C1393850%2C1428716%2C1328961%2C1455557%2C529523%2C1610598%2C1537587%2C1348320%2C1520634%2C1709944%2C412807%2C1690475%2C1716039%2C1631617%2C1642602%2C1635516%2C1476203%2C1557270%2C1291205%2C478890%2C607567%2C590021%2C478890%2C1291205%2C1520412%2C1669688%2C1678636%2C440913%2C1528768%2C1669688%2C1684727%2C1430690%2C1525069%2C145990%2C1657696%2C1464379%2C1437909%2C1336642%2C1604868%2C1626746%2C627855%2C1511616%2C1451666%2C263339%2C1277771%2C1713279%2C1326984%2C1372234%2C1321520%2C537232%2C1527013%2C1681827%2C529523%2C422223%2C1678569%2C1616252%2C1650192%2C1624545%2C1583570%2C1223893%2C1668758%2C1722746%2C1530876%2C1701565%2C1600822%2C392059%2C1703148%2C1370825%2C1647180%2C453245%2C1631617%2C1258298%2C1619955%2C1699788%2C1414099%2C1641687%2C134063%2C1398248%2C1592878%2C1515289%2C1674527&page=200","id":"","title":"Meetup Groups","updated":"Sun Oct 24 18:32:27 EDT 2010","description":"API method for accessing meetup groups","method":"Groups","lat":""}}

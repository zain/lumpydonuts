Join us on October 28th for An Evening in Conversation with The Lost Girls!  <br \/><br \/><b>Authors' Bio:<\/b><br \/><br \/>In 2006, The Lost Girls – Amanda Pressner, Jennifer Baggett and Holly Corbett – left their jobs, boyfriends, apartments and everything familiar behind in New York City to embark on a year-long search for adventure and inspiration. <br \/><br \/>Journeying across four continents and more than a dozen countries, they shared their experiences with other aspiring vagabonds on their website, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lostgirlsworld.com\" target=\"_blank\">LostGirlsWorld.com<\/a>.  <br \/><br \/>Shortly after completing their 60,000 mile lap around the globe, The Lost Girls signed on with HarperCollins to turn their tales into a travel memoir – <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.booksinc.net\/book\/9780061689062\" target=\"_blank\">The Lost Girls: Three Friends. Four Continents. One Unconventional Detour Around the Globe<\/a><\/i> – which hit shelves in May 2010. Currently, all three Lost Girls reside in New York, where between working on their second book and turning their website into an online travel magazine, they still find the time to take trips as a trio.<br \/><br \/>The Lost Girls have been featured in such media outlets as:  The New York Times, The Globe and Mail, Real Simple Travel, Budget Travel, Girlfriend Getaways, Company, For Me magazine, CNN Project Life, Jaunted.com, Budget Travel Online, National Geographic Traveler online, the Guardian, and many more<br \/><br \/><b>About LostGirlsWorld.com:<\/b><br \/><br \/>Since its launch, Lost Girls World has grown to become the premiere travel and lifestyle website for young women.  Readers turn to LGW as a trusted source of advice and information on ways to fit adventure and exploration into their everyday lives. They’re seeking to fuel and fulfill their wanderlust, and are inspired by stories of other Lost Girls currently on the road and living out their travel wish-lists. Because they want to find the best, most rewarding route to their own dream destinations, Lost Girls World provides smart, service-oriented articles that will help them get there-without sacrificing their career goals or breaking the bank.  LGW is Winner of the 2007 Travvies Award for “Best Group Written Travel Blog” and a Finalist in both the  2007 Blogger’s Choice Awards and 2008 Weblog Awards.<br \/><br \/><b>Meet Amanda, Holly and Jen:<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>Amanda Pressner<\/b> caught the travel bug as a kid when her family did a cross-country trip in a camper van nicknamed “The Blue Moose.” Between trips abroad, she writes for such publications as USA Today, Shape, Travel + Leisure, and Cosmopolitan. While she’s previously served as a diet and nutrition editor at SELF and Shape, she still believes the best reason to hit the road is to eat. She is a native of Tampa, FL. One thing I’d never travel without: A universal memory card reader (for snagging my fellow traveler’s pix!) My favorite way to “get lost”: Hourlong $3 reflexology treatments in Laos.<br \/><br \/><b>Holly C. Corbett<\/b> used to run laps around her block as a kid, and now trains for marathons and triathlons. When she’s not jogging, she’s a freelance writer whose work has appeared in publications such as Women’s Health, Prevention, Seventeen, Shape, Woman’s Day, SELF, Newsday, MensFitness.com, Budget Travel, and Fitness. Her adventures have taken her to all seven continents, where she’s swam past icebergs in the Antarctic Ocean, slalom water-skied next to alligators in Florida, and hiked the Leaping Tiger Gorge in China. She was born in Syracuse, NY. One thing I’d never travel without: my running shoes. My favorite way to “get lost”: To make friends with a local and wander around a new town without an agenda or map.<br \/><br \/><b>Jennifer Baggett<\/b> never dreamed that she’d become a writer, but she’s thrilled to have cut her teeth on The Lost Girls memoir. Prior to the trip, she worked as a marketing and promotions professional and held positions at Sundance Channel, Vh1, and NBC Universal. A dedicated film buff, Jen’s passport is full of stamps from destinations that she discovered while watching movies as a kid. She hails from Bowie, MD. One thing I’d never travel without: My fellow Lost Girls! And a good book for long train, plane, bus or rickshaw rides! My favorite way to “get lost”: Disconnecting from all email and internet and being willing to abandon even the best laid travel plan for a spontaneous adventure!<br \/>","name":"An Evening in Conversation with The Lost Girls - SF Travel Lectures Series Event","group":{"id":959276,"name":"San Francisco Travel Book Club and Lectures Series","join_mode":"open","urlname":"SF-Travel-Book-Club-and-Lecture-Series"}},{"trending_rank":56,"status":"upcoming","maybe_rsvp_count":0,"photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/6\/9\/global_14712873.jpeg","id":"15032061","distance":2.2603659629821777,"time":1288321200000,"yes_rsvp_count":2,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SFfreestyle\/calendar\/15032061\/","description":"We get together to practice rhyming.

We’ll watch it at the Westfield Century 9 theaters.  You can enter the mall directly from the Powell Street BART station.  The theaters are on the 5th floor. <br \/><br \/>If you like, meet me at Panda Express at 6:15PM near the BART mall entrance and we can get food in the food court beforehand.  I plan to arrive at the theater at 7:15PM to grab seats for the 8PM performance.  I’ll send out my cell phone # beforehand and leave it on until 8PM. <br \/><br \/>After the movie, if you’re interested, we can meet back outside the theater where they collected our tickets and decide if there is interest in getting a snack or drink.  <br \/><br \/>The tickets are not sold through the meetup group.  This is a public performance at theaters all over, including several in the Bay Area.  You can buy tickets at the box office, or use the links above to buy tickets online.  If SF is not close for you or if you want to organize a different MST3K meetup, please do --- I can make you an “Organizer”.<br \/><br \/>In case there’re a lot of us, here’re the details…:<br \/><br \/>Look for me.  I’ll send out my cell phone # on Tuesday, October 27th to those who have signed up by Monday, October 25th.   I’ll be wearing my black derby hat.  I’ll be taking my hat off and turning my cell phone off at 8PM and putting\/turning them back on when the film performance lets out.<br \/><br \/><u><b>If you’re coming for food beforehand:<\/b><\/u><br \/>There are two well-marked entrances from BART into Westfield Mall.  One end says Bloomingdale’s, the other end says Nordstrom.  Both have food courts as soon as you walk in.  These are on the “Concourse” level.  They are a two-minute walk from each other inside of the mall.  Look for me inside of Panda Express at the smaller food court at the Nordstrom entrance.  I plan to be at Panda’s from 6:15 to 7PM.<br \/><br \/><u><b>The MST3K film performance:<\/b><\/u><br \/>Make your way up to the 5th floor Century theaters, which are on the Mission Street side of the mall (BART is on the Market Street side). Although I don’t expect a line, I will be in line if there is one. I will hang out where they take the tickets from 7:10-7:20, then go inside. Once you enter the theater, you will likely be at the open middle divider section of the theater where there are a few handicap seats spread out over a long open row.  I hope to get seats in the row immediately behind those.  It will be more likely we can sit as a group, if you can get there early. If you arrive afterwards, come on in and look for us. <br \/><br \/><u><b>If you’re up for food afterwards:<\/b><\/u><br \/>After the movie, I’ll head back to where they took our tickets.  I’ll hang there for about 5 minutes, then head on down the express elevators at the theater to Mission St..

CPU and I\/O is lower, storage is slow and a database may be very slow. Fair resource allocation is not guaranteed, reliability and safety guarantees are opaque and there are proprietary rather than open APIs. Restrictions on multicast and even socket creation significantly curtail many approaches. We will use source code and measurement tools to demonstrate the effects of caching in the EC2 and Google App Engine cloud environments.<br \/><br \/>In the webcast, we will show how to use Ehcache, Hibernate, Quartz, Tomcat (or other containers) in conjunction with Terracotta to get to hundreds of nodes without all the separate stages of architecture and design such as messaging, partitioning, NoSQL, and more while avoiding cloud limitations. This recipe for scaling from 1 node to 1000 provides a seamless continuum within which your applications can operate and scale. This scalability continuum has implications on EC2 and EC2 has implications on the continuum.<br \/><br \/>We will also cover the ramifications of cloud on large-scale data management and we will apply the scalability continuum to our cloud-based applications to lessen our dependence on the database and, thus, take full advantage of the cloud's elasticity.<br \/><br \/>You will learn about:<br \/><br \/>Intro to Cloud<br \/>When it Rains: Cloud Problems<br \/>EC2 Caching restrictions and options<br \/>Ehcache + Terracotta as a scalability solution that alleviates your need for complex database infrastructure<br \/>EC2 and VMWare best practices for scaling with Terracotta's frameworks<br \/>The CAP Theorem and approaches to cache consistency: ACID, BASE, None<br \/>Terracotta's cloud-capable runtime and how to actually deploy to hundreds of nodes in hours<br \/>Example App and Demo in EC2: app using Spring, JPA, MySQL\/Derby, Ehcache, Quartz, Terracotta<br \/>Conclusions<br \/><br \/>Please register for the WebEx even if you are unable to attend and you will get an email with a link to the recording.<br \/>","name":"LIVE WEBCAST: Scaling from 1 to 1000 nodes in the cloud","group":{"id":1601598,"name":"Terracotta User Group","join_mode":"open","urlname":"TerracottaTech"}},{"trending_rank":101,"status":"upcoming","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/5\/a\/c\/global_17075548.jpeg","maybe_rsvp_count":0,"venue":{"id":1351798,"zip":"94109","lon":-122.421324,"name":"Concordia Argonaut","state":"CA","address_1":"1142 Van Ness Ave ","lat":37.786396,"city":"San Francisco","country":"us"},"id":"hlgfpynnbmc","time":1288362600000,"distance":2.4554591178894043,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/hackers\/calendar\/hlgfpynnbmc\/","yes_rsvp_count":1,"description":"Alrighty Concordia Hackers this event happens every Friday morning at the Concordia Club from about 7:30am-9:30am.

You’ll create a simple application Goodbye Hello World using the View based application template and the partial curl transition. I'll show you how to use tab views as well.  I'll get more into Xocde and how to customize it. We’ll go through Objective C basics: classes, objects, message syntax, properties, dot notation, I’ll explain the SDK and the basic architecture of an iPhone application including the various design patterns used in the SDK that you will need to know         <br \/>Model-View-Controller (MVC)<br \/>Delegation<br \/>Target-Action<br \/>Block Objects<br \/>Managed Memory Model<br \/><br \/>Then we’ll take a look at how iOS 4 works; How your application is launched, how it runs at runtime, and how it needs to behave in the multitasking world of iOS 4.<br \/><br \/>Then I’ll take you through the real world development process of developing a utility application. We’ll start by using Interface Builder to design the user interface.  You’ll work with the basic UIKit classes and view controllers and views. You will use labels, images, buttons and button-like controls, gesture recognizers, and text fields. You’ll work with the notification system and use Block objects to respond to notifications. You'll  scroll the view using core animation when the keyboard blocks a text field. You’ll discover outlets and target-action and how to work with properties.  You’ll also save some data to user preferences. Later you’ll take that data and save it using Core Data. You’ll use a Web view to display information and even have it dial a phone number you display for you. Then you’ll add sound, more animation using Core Animation, and even access to the user's iPod library to allow them to listen to their own music. During the process I’ll show you how to use the debugger to deal with errors and use breakpoints to actually see what’s going on as your application executes.<br \/><br \/>Then we go through the process of provisioning your application to run on the iPhone: ad hoc provisioning so you can have people beta test your app, and finally getting it ready for the store and the process of submitting to the store and how to avoid getting it rejected.<br \/><br \/>With all this under your belt, you’ll go to work on an industrial strength application. I’ll take you through the design process and you’ll create a user interface and application design. You’ll learn all about Table views and how to make them work the way you want, including how to customize Table view cells. You’ll save the state of an application and add your application’s user preferences to the Settings application. You’ll also handle the situation under iOS 4, of the user changing preferences while your app is in background. You’ll work with content both in the application bundle and download content from the web to use in your application. You’ll work more Web views and how to use your own content, and even access web pages without leaving your application. We’ll use the file system and create and restore files and enter the magical world of property lists. Since your application will be multiple pages, you’ll use a Table view to navigate the pages and how navigation controllers work. <br \/><br \/>Finally you’ll dig deeply into the crown jewels of the iPhone: mapping and location services. You’ll display maps, create custom annotations, and even drag annotations and change their coordinates and what they display. You’ll use reverse geocoding to create addresses from coordinates and then zoom the map to display the regions on a map. You’ll learn all about core location and how it works including the services available to reduce battery drain, and you’ll  keep your application running in background and display local notifications to the user about location changes, even when your application is running in background. <br \/><br \/>About the iPhone Boot Camp<br \/>The iPhone Boot camp is the leading training workshop for professional iPhone development.

Before the ride, the participants gather at Justin Herman Plaza, by the beginning of Market St. and Embarcadero. A number of Critical Mass riders (usually 5 to 10) are also World Naked Bike Ride members and they have been doing Critical Mass nude all summer to promote WNBR and its protest on our nation's oil dependency.<br \/><br \/>The September ride was the year's warmest ride and unseasonably warm weather might extend throughout October. The Halloween Bike Sketch Meet is taking place in what is typically the largest Critical Mass of the year. It is understandably the funnest ride of the year and should not be missed. There are the usual cast of World Naked Bike Ride participants ready and willing for life drawing poses. Plus there are the vast numbers of costumed bike riders and their equally dolled up bikes. This is one of the best chances you will get all year if you like sketching people and bikes<br \/><br \/>The WNBR riders and costumed CM participants make excellent subjects for figure drawing. Best of all, no modeling fees required. Bring your sketch pads and\/or your cameras and look for the nude riders between the pay toilet and street vendor displays along the pedestrian route to the Embarcadero-Ferry Building crossing. And think about participating in the Critical Mass. Critical Mass ride is much fun and if you never have before, bring your bike and join in the Mass ride after you sketch. The ride has no predetermined start or finish time, but usually it starts just after 6:00PM, so you can have nearly 2 hours of drawing and photo time. Typically the bike ride goes on for 3 hours, but you may drop out at any time and place of your choosing. Bringing friends is encouraged (with bikes).<br \/>","name":"Halloween Bike Sketch Meet - Critical Mass","group":{"id":234020,"name":"The San Francisco Figure Drawing Group","join_mode":"open","urlname":"SanFranciscoFigureDrawing"}},{"trending_rank":106,"status":"upcoming","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/5\/a\/global_14937418.jpeg","maybe_rsvp_count":0,"venue":{"id":1304173,"zip":"94133","lon":-122.407388,"name":"Carmel Blue pregnancy and parenting center","state":"CA","address_1":"1418 Grant Street","lat":37.799959,"city":"San Francisco","country":"us"},"id":"gpkwnynnbmc","time":1288396800000,"distance":3.649834156036377,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/newparents-335\/calendar\/gpkwnynnbmc\/","yes_rsvp_count":1,"description":"Hi mommies\/daddies,<br \/><br \/>I love this music class, my little 3 month old has a load of fun too.

A nutritarian understands that food has powerful disease-protecting and therapeutic effects and seeks to consume a broad array of micronutrients via their food choices. It is not sufficient to merely avoid fats, consume foods with a low glycemic index, lower the intake of animal products, or eat a diet of mostly raw foods. A truly healthy diet must be micronutrient rich and the micronutrient richness must be adjusted to meet individual needs. The foods with the highest micronutrient per calorie scores are green vegetables, colorful vegetables, and fresh fruits. For optimal health and to combat disease, it is necessary to consume enough of these foods that deliver the highest concentration of nutrients.<br \/><br \/>A nutritarian is a person whose food choices are influenced by nutritional quality.<br \/>","name":"San Francisco Nutritarians Meetup","group":{"id":1690751,"name":"San Francisco Nutritarians","join_mode":"open","urlname":"SanFranciscoNutritarians"}},{"id":"15062553","distance":0.9670621752738953,"time":1288402200000,"trending_rank":61,"status":"upcoming","yes_rsvp_count":2,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/sf-meditation\/calendar\/15062553\/","maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Welcome!

If you like a large selection of games to play with a variety of people, this is the group for you.  Five hours of games!<br \/><br \/>We meet Friday nights, 7:00pm (sharp!)  to 12:00 midnight (yes, 5 hours!).  You don't have to stay all night though :)<br \/><br \/><br \/>DESCRIPTION:<br \/>    While we are serious about games, SF Games is a friendly social club with games, not a group just for intense gamers.<br \/><br \/>     SF Games is a collective name for a group of people who get together and play board games and card games every week.  We're not sponsored by any cafe or games company.  Some of us have been playing games for years, others only a few months.  What we share is our love of games, all kinds.  SF Games is free to attend, but please buy something at the cafe. Bring your favorite games to play if you have them. Be prepared to learn a new game.  Come early or you might not get into the early games!  Don't know how to play?  We'll teach you. <br \/><br \/><br \/>IF YOU ARRIVE AFTER 7:00:<br \/>     You're absolutely still welcome! Many of us stay all night, but many of us also come and go. If you come after 7:00, simply hang out until you see a game end.  In most games you're welcome to sit at the edge of the table and watch until the game ends.  Be sure to introduce yourself.  Since our main group runs 5 hours, you will be able to get into a game if you wait until the next break.  Most people can get in 3 games during the evening.  <br \/><br \/><br \/>FAQ <br \/><br \/>1 - WHO ATTENDS? <br \/>     All kinds of people ages 17 to about 70, male, female, straight, gay, bi have come to SF Games over the years.   Everybody who can play games is welcome to attend.  The number of people varies from about 20 to 45 out of a universe of about 200. <br \/><br \/><br \/>2 - WHAT KIND OF GAMES?<br \/>     What we play depends on who comes and what they bring. Generally, games can be divided into two groups: strategy games and social games.   <br \/><br \/><br \/>STRATEGY GAMES:<br \/>     Among the most common popular board games we play are Ticket To Ride, Puerto Rico, Power Grid, Settlers of Catan, Acquire, Caylus, Can't Stop, Carcassonne, Rumis, Tigris &amp; Euphrates, Alhambra, Age of Steam, Ra, Goa, Cheops, Age of Empires III, Taj Mahal, Notre Dame, Modern Art, On the Underground, Louis XIV, Web of Power, Lost Cities, China, Thurn and Taxis, Vinci, Amun-Re, and even good old Scrabble.  We also have been known to play Samurai, Air Baron, Illuminati, and other less common European-style board games too numerous to describe. <br \/><br \/><br \/>SOCIAL GAMES:  <br \/>     These are for people who like lots of conversation and laughs, where having a good time is not as important as refining your game-winning strategy.  Examples of social games we play are: Apples to Apples, Taboo, Can't Stop, Set, Fluxx, Boggle and Hoopla.  Feel free to bring other social games.  <br \/><br \/><br \/>SPECIAL DECK CARD GAMES:<br \/>     We also play games that use special packs such as For Sale, Zendo, RoboRally, San Juan, Bohnanza, Coloretto, Modern Art, Condottiere and Bang. <br \/><br \/><br \/>TRADITIONAL DECK CARD GAMES: <br \/>     They tend to be focused on these ones using traditional decks.  Click on the game names to bring up rules for the games: Spades, Eucre, Sheepshead, Hearts, 500 Rum, 500, and once in awhile Cribbage.  Recently (March 2007) we began playing 500, a trick-taking card game based partly on Eucre.  <br \/><br \/>We do not play Magic the Gathering or other collectible card type games.  We also do not play long-form (more than 3 hour) games, though people from our group do meet independently for this.  We're a social group first.<br \/><br \/><br \/>4 - DO YOU PLAY MY FAVORITE GAME?  <br \/>     Don't ask us if we play a game -- come by and bring your game and see! <br \/><br \/><br \/>3 - DOES SF GAMES MEET EVERY WEEK?  <br \/>     This is probably the most frequent question.  SF Games meets every Friday of the year unless Christmas Eve or Day falls on a game night.  Then we don't meet.  Otherwise we meet, rain or shine.   <br \/><br \/><br \/>HISTORY OF SF GAMES:<br \/>     SF Games was founded July 5, 1995 by David Kaye. SF Games was begun not as a games group but as a social group with games.  This important difference we feel has contributed to the longevity of the group and the continued enjoyment by members year in and year out.  <br \/><br \/>Welcome to our visitors from other countries!  Many of our games are of German origin, and many can be played without extensive knowledge of English.  People from all over the world have joined us during their vacations in San Francisco.  We have also been featured in stories appearing in the press in Italy and Germany.  <br \/><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sfgames.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Our Homepage<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sfgate.com\/cgi-bin\/article.cgi?file=\/chronicle\/archive\/2003\/01\/19\/LV212070.DTL\" target=\"_blank\">Chronicle Coverage of Us<\/a><br \/>","name":"SF Games Weekly Meetup","group":{"id":777322,"name":"SF Games","join_mode":"open","urlname":"boardgames-488"}},{"trending_rank":45,"status":"upcoming","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/0\/4\/f\/global_18754175.jpeg","maybe_rsvp_count":0,"venue":{"id":1289346,"zip":"94110","phone":"(415) 920-2223 ","lon":-122.416078,"name":"Shotwell Studios","state":"CA","address_1":"3252-A 19th st.","address_2":"Btwn Folsom and South Van Ness","lat":37.760437,"city":"San Francisco","country":"us"},"id":"15120946","time":1288404000000,"distance":2.182626485824585,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/sfbayoneness\/calendar\/15120946\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"description":"In association with Footloose Studios, come join your Oneness Family in a celebratory night of meditation, deeksha and dancing!<br \/><br \/>SF Bay Area Oneness community leaders are excited to host this event that is open to the general public.

She plays the flighty, strong-willed Elizabeth (“Babou” to her friends), who lives with her more conservative daughter Esmeralda in the north of France. When the latter announces that Elizabeth is not invited to her upcoming wedding, mom decamps for the coast of Belgium in order to prove to her child that she can live a “normal” life. There, her gregarious but no-nonsense nature brings her in contact with friendly locals, a homeless couple traveling rough and an increasingly jealous cadre of coworkers. Marc Fitoussi’s charming script refuses to point fingers, presenting mother and daughter as the flawed people they both are. Adding additional cinephiliac frisson to the scenario is the fact that Lolita Chammah, who plays Esmeralda, is Huppert’s real-life child.<br \/><br \/><br \/>","name":"French Cinema Now--Copacabana","group":{"id":686833,"name":"Palo Alto Independent Films Group","join_mode":"open","urlname":"bayareamovieclub"}},{"trending_rank":12,"status":"upcoming","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/c\/global_18237628.jpeg","maybe_rsvp_count":0,"venue":{"id":821917,"lon":-122.41981,"name":"War Memorial Opera House","state":"CA","address_1":"301 Van Ness Avenue at Grove Street, ","lat":37.778271,"country":"us","city":"San Francisco"},"id":"14878256","time":1288407600000,"distance":2.2115371227264404,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bay-Area-Classical-Music\/calendar\/14878256\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"description":"Dear Opera Lovers,   <br \/><br \/><span style=\"color: red\"><b>*LATEST TIX INFO:<\/b><\/span> <br \/>As of 10\/18 for any of you who STILL haven't gotten tickets, this one currently works for <span style=\"color: blue\"><b>30% off<\/b><\/span>: <br \/>Enjoy <b>30% off<\/b> on the following performances: October 20, 23, 26, 29 and November 5, 11, 17, 27.*  <br \/>Not valid on previously purchased tickets. <br \/><br \/>BUY NOW online: <b>sfopera.com\/offer<\/b>  <br \/>ENTER CODE: <b>MBEM30<\/b>  <br \/><i><span style=\"color: red\"><b>Please get you tix ASAP.

Yeah, then all of a sudden it disappeared and found no trace, right? Well, b\/c i wasn't having a good karma w\/ Figaro(That ruthless man!!), i had to cancel the event. But wait, this doesn't mean i am backing out on other exciting opera events for the season. It just hasn't begun on the right foot, that's all. Ok, getting down to the bottom line: What about Puccini's Madama Butterfly?? Details are as below:   <br \/><br \/><br \/><b>Madama Butterfly<\/b>   <br \/><i>San Francisco Opera<\/i>   <br \/>    <br \/>The great tragic love story returns in a classic new-to-San Francisco production by Broadway legend Harold Prince (Sweeney Todd, The Phantom of the Opera). Svetla Vassileva sings the title role in October, a young Japanese geisha who falls for a charismatic but callous American sailor (tenor Stefano Secco). The Times of London praised the soprano’s &quot;beautifully free and unencumbered voice…capable of the most intimate pianissimo but also riding the whole orchestra with ease.&quot; Daniella Dessì, a singer praised by Opera News for her “penetrating, extravagant, unabashedly emotional” voice, sings the title role for November performances.   <br \/><br \/>Prince's staging, created for Lyric Opera of Chicago and infused with touches of traditional Japanese theater, &quot;remains one of the most beautiful in Lyric’s repertory&quot; (Opera News). Music Director Nicola Luisotti &quot;mixes Puccini’s colors strongly and fearlessly, so that the collision of East and West is even more menacing than Puccini knew&quot; (The Times of London).   <br \/><br \/><br \/>Venue: War Memorial Opera House    <br \/>Date: October 29, 2010 8:00 PM    <br \/>City: San Francisco    <br \/>Price Range: $60 and up    <br \/>Tickets: (415) 864-3330    <br \/>*As of now(9\/24) there are still seats available @$60 the cheapest (Yes, it's A-cast performance incl. Daniella Dessi), and if we get enough number of people, i think we can get group discount (15% off if 10 or more; 30% off if 30 or more). But we need to act quickly since tix are selling like crazy... based on my experience w\/ Figaro!

So since the days are getting shorter as Fall approaches and generally we aren't working shorter hours, it is getting harder to fit a ride in after work on Wednesdays without ending up riding in the dark, our group has agreed to initiate a new thing to do, go out to China Camp for a bike ride on Saturdays. We will depart the city from the same meet up location as usual (at the northwest corner of the intersection of Fulton and Park Presidio) and we will carpool with our bikes in our trunks over the Golden Gate into San Rafael. I know it is early and waking up early is tough on Saturday but hey on the bright side by the time you are back from this trip you can still make it for lunch! So please join us and we will have a blast!<br \/><br \/>This ride is for those who are thinking about stepping it up a notch from the usual trails we ride in the Golden Gate Park. People looking for an injection of adventure into their weekly grind are welcome. We will encounter a lot more dust, bigger rocks, tighter and twistier single track, and longer up hills and down hills than our city's park has to offer. Not to mention we will have possible close encounters with friendly wild deer, fawn, and turkey. Also, we will wait for those who are a little slower and help you make this ride as safe as possible for you.

Join us in the shadow of the Washington Monument. And bring your indoor voice. Or don't. If you'd rather stay home, go to work, or drive your kids to soccer practice... Actually, please come anyway.

It is not a clothing optional lodge. Wear shoes or flip flops for outside of lodge (you'll remove them before entering).<br \/><br \/>Cotton is most comfortable\/breathable. Avoid metal (zippers, rivets, underwires, etc) on your clothing and remove jewelry (except wedding bands) before entering the lodge. If you have a wedding band, these can be left on if you'd like. We will have red cloth to wrap it with to avoid any issues. (The same is <br \/>true for rings that don't want to budge.) <br \/><br \/>Bring light layers as we will be outside much of the time. You may also want this to put on after the lodge. <br \/> <br \/>Giving back: Traditionally things like horses and buffalo robes were gifted to the lodge pourer...things that would support his family for the week. Given that's not really feasible in today's culture, we ask that a $55 donation be made. (We will gift a $10 land use fee to Joyce and Ron as a thank you for allowing the use of their land and resources and $45 will be in support of the circle.) For those who would prefer to adhere strictly to tradition, please be sure any buffalo robes provided were taken in a good way. <br \/> <br \/>This event is not weather dependent...we will be there no matter the weather.

Come meet other backpackers, new folk and trail buddies, to share your stories of toil and trouble in the outdoors and plans for upcoming, even aspirational adventures.  Doesn't matter if you've been out with us before, just come and meet other backpackers.  There'll be food and drink and maps for your enjoyment.<br \/><br \/>I'll provide bacon, mimosas and waffles in abundance.  You bring a dish to share, extra points (because points are important!) if it's your grandma's recipe for something I've never had before.  But make your dish a small-medium size one, somehow I always end up with tons of leftovers which nobody takes home.  I will curse you forever if you leave a dozen donuts at my house.  :)  If you know what you'll bring leave a comment so we won't have too much duplication.<br \/><br \/>Show up whenever you want (earlier is better to meet people before it gets busy and my hosting abilities are overwhelmed) and stick around as long as you want (usually winds down a bit after 2 or so but keeps going till later in the afternoon.)  Parking around my house can be difficult (not North Beach difficult, but not easy.)  I encourage public transportation, 24th St. BART is about 6-7 blocks away and the 27 Bryant Muni bus goes right by my house.

Our starting point is a Peets Coffee &amp; Tea that is underneath Whole Foods Market. Because this Peets is too small to hold all of us we will step outside of Peets after 11:00 AM and stand in front of the door. At 11:10 AM we will start walking. I will have clip boards for everyone to sign (print) themselves in, and name tags. Also I will need volunteers to help take roll and carry the clipboards at the first part of the walk. As it is at the beginning of the rainy season we will NOT bring lunches and instead eat lunch in cafes.<br \/><br \/>First we will look at the great historical Spreckels Mansion where now an incredibly successful woman novelist lives. Then we will walk inside Lafayette Square Park to use their big restrooms and then admire the view from the top of the little hill there where I will collect the money.<br \/><br \/>Then we will walk to Jackson and then West on Jackson to Scott and then take a group photo in Alta Plaza. Then West on Washington and then turn left on Spruce to California Street where we expect to arrive about 12:20 PM at a Starbucks. Then we eat lunch in the several cafes along California between Spruce &amp; Walnut. We will take 40 minutes for lunch and reform as a group in front of the Starbucks. We will then see Le Petit Trianon which is probably the greatest mansion in SF. In front of this giant mansion with interiors of marble and exquisite stain glass built in 1904 is a giant double staircase made entirely of marble and brass.<br \/><br \/>Then we walk East to Billionaires' Row and see things such as a big silver robot with a large male sex organ that looks like a microphone. The robot used to stare across the street at a famous computer pioneer billionaire's mansion that was being renovated. (After the renovation was done the robot turned his torso to the right.) We will see another mansion for sale for $65 million that needs $10 million more to finish. They will only let people look inside who can prove they're worth $800 million, except of course for low paid security guards. I was inside one of these mansions, but that one was for sale for only $55 million. <b>We will see many strange things, but we will have adequate restroom stops.<\/b> We will end at our starting point about 4:10 PM.<br \/><br \/><span style=\"color: crimson\">I recently found out that a big old (1960) Hollywood color movie called &quot;Portrait in Black&quot; was filmed on Billionaires' Row. Many of the big stars of the past appear such as Anthony Quinn, Lana Turner, Sandra Dee, Lloyd Noland, Ray Walston, Richard Basehart, John Saxon and Ana May Wong. We will be walking up the Baker Street Steps which is right where Anthony Quinn lands in a fall from a nearby mansion roof. They used a dummy for the fall. If you have Netflix you can watch it like I recently did.

This year, The Witch of Endor, a new opera based on the music of Henry Purcell, will premier at SMV.<br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>The Witch of Endor is an expanded work drawn from an English opera scene by Henry Purcell with Shawnette Sulker in the title role and Colby Roberts as King Saul, the first King of Israel.  It features &quot;In Guilty Night,&quot; Purcell's setting of an anonymous libretto based on a story from The Hebrew Bible.  <br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>Also featured are selections from Purcell's liturgical canon as well as excepts from two Purcell operas, The Indian Queen and Abdelazar.  This &quot;new work&quot; is told in the style of an ancient Greek tragedy.  Performing with Ms. Sulker and Mr. Roberts are soprano Lindsey McLennan (Dreams) and John Minagro (Samuel), The Urban Opera Chorus and String Ensemble.  The production also includes three silent films by Brendan Bolles.  <br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>Tickets to this event may be purchased through the Urban Opera website, www.urbanopera.org<br \/><br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>Urban Opera's The Witch of Endor<br \/><br \/>October 30 and 31; Saturday &amp; Sunday at 4 p.m.   Run time:  1 hour 5 minutes<br \/><br \/>2325 Union Street (@Steiner), San Francisco, CA<br \/><br \/>","name":"Witch of Endor Opera","group":{"id":26434,"name":"The San Francisco Expat Brit Meetup Group","join_mode":"open","urlname":"brit-92"}},{"trending_rank":70,"status":"upcoming","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/2\/3\/global_14358803.jpeg","maybe_rsvp_count":0,"venue":{"id":1098976,"zip":"94127","phone":"415-681-4263","lon":-122.469713,"name":"Just Awesome!

We know that every living being has energy within and around the body to be alive. This energy is called Chi (vital energy) and it is vital for the physical body to exist. The physical body usually has problems because the energy does not flow properly. By stimulating the energy to flow properly as it is supposed to, the natural ability of the body to heal itself will be able to function again, and the physical body will recover. Reiki healing is able not only to stimulate the energy to flow properly but also to cleanse the energy within and around the body to speed up the healing process. <br \/>","name":"1h Private Session to pamper yourself with Reiki Tummo Healing Energy","group":{"id":1372234,"name":"Reiki Tummo (Kundalini) and Heart-Centered Meditation","join_mode":"open","urlname":"Reiki-Tummo-SF"}},{"trending_rank":17,"status":"upcoming","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/6\/9\/global_16244409.jpeg","maybe_rsvp_count":0,"venue":{"id":885848,"zip":"94111","lon":-122.398882,"name":"Schroeders German Restaurant","state":"CA","address_1":"240 Front St.","lat":37.793946,"city":"San Francisco","country":"us"},"id":"15130436","time":1288481400000,"distance":3.7522976398468018,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/atheists-561\/calendar\/15130436\/","yes_rsvp_count":32,"description":"This month we are fortunate to host Dr. Michael Parenti, an internationally known award-winning author and lecturer.

I'll be at the West end of the Bridge, close to the De Young walkway. this is close to the Lincoln 10th ave.

The De Young Museum tower should be to your left.  There is a cross walk to your right. Cross the street at the crosswalk on your right. Do not to the front entrance of the De Young. Having Crossed John F. Kennedy Blvd.  Walk west a little further west and you will see a trail entering the Redwood grove.  You will  by now see something that looks like a giant tooth.

Despite how exotic and mysterious Buddhism may appear, the teachings and spiritual methods of Shakyamuni Buddha are fairly straightforward and verifiable in our everyday experience - all we have to do is give them a try and see where they take us. This is not about learning complicated philosophies or taking on some exotic lifestyle; rather, it is about discovering true happiness right here and right now, deepening that happiness, and sharing it with the people in our lives.<br \/><br \/>Nichiren Buddhist Sangha of San Francisco is led by Ryuei Shonin (aka Rev. Michael McCormick), one of the few Americans to be fully ordained as a teacher in the Nichiren Shu (a Japanese lineage founded in 13th century Japan) and the only disciple of the Ven. Ryusho Matsuda (retired bishop of the Nichiren Order of North America). <br \/><br \/>Nichiren Buddhist Sanha of San Francisco has three components that focus on different aspects of Buddhist training:<br \/><br \/><b>3:00 - Meditation<\/b> The Buddha discovered that simply by quietly sitting still we can discover a peaceful abiding in what it true and real. Ryuei Shonin will be happy to provide instruction for those who have not practiced Buddhist meditation before. (For those who may wonder this instruction is based upon the Chih-Kuan or Tranquility and Insight lineage of T'ien-t'ai Buddhism that is still practiced within Nichiren Shu)<br \/><br \/><b>3:45 -  Discussion<\/b> What did the Buddha actually teach? How are those teachings relevant to us? More importantly: How can they help us? Ryuei Shonin will facilitate a discussion whereby we can explore real life issues with each other in light of the Buddha's teachings in a safe and accepting environment. (For instance, many people benefit from the 12 steps, but how does this compare with the Buddha's Eightfold Path?)<br \/><br \/><b>4:30 - Chanting<\/b> Many people only think of silent meditation when they think of Buddhist practice, but traditionally Buddhism has long used the language of symbols (mandala), sound (mantra), and bodily postures and hand signs (mudra) to appeal to the imagination, arouse our aspiration, and uplift the heart. Utilizing the power of mandala, mantra, and mudra, we go beyond mindful observation and conceptual learning to an immediate and visceral transformation of our thoughts, words, and deeds so that our lives will resonate with the awakened selfless compassion of buddhahood.<br \/><br \/>Looking forward to meeting you at Nichiren Buddhist Sangha of San Francisco,<br \/>Ryuei Shonin (Rev.

Reiki TUMMO is practiced by thousands of people around the world. It is a safe and natural way to promote health and well being by restoring balance to the mind, body and spirit.<br \/><br \/><b>Who should attend?<\/b><br \/>Anyone who feels like they could benefit from deep relaxation. The sessions are especially helpful if you are experiencing:   <br \/><br \/>    * Stress<br \/>    * Anxiety<br \/>    * Physical Illness<br \/>    * Insomnia<br \/>    * Sadness<br \/>    * Muscle Injuries<br \/><br \/>    * Addictions<br \/>    * Emotional Turmoil<br \/>    * Anger<br \/>    * Depression<br \/><br \/><b>What to expect?<\/b><br \/>Reiki TUMMO works by stimulating the flow of vital energy within and around your body. This helps to recharge and rebalance the flow of subtle energies, relieving the effect of stress while activating the body's ability to heal itself. At the clinic we offer group healing treatment where a number of trained Reiki Tummo healers will work together to channel Reiki Tummo healing energy from tlheir hands to the client who is relaxing on a massage table. Sessions range between 20-30min in duration. <br \/><br \/>Reiki Tummo treatments affect each person differently. Most feel deeply relaxed and energized with a better sense of well-being.

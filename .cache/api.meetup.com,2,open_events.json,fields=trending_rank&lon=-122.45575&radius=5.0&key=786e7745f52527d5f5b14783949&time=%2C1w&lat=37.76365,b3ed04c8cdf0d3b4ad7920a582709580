However, I believe it is fundamentally an exciting thriller and a very impressive extended essay on the psychology and anthropology of humanity's behaviour in the face of global tragedy. The science of the comet, its formation in the distant Oort cloud, its orbit, its structure, its evolution as it accelerates towards the sun and the aftermath as the remnants race away from earth back into deep space, is touched upon but only in a cursory fashion. Sci-fi fans will probably think the book relatively weak in this area and would have hoped for much more depth in the science. Thriller fans, on the other hand, will see &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; as an exciting post-apocalyptic novel that just begs to be turned into a movie with an enormous budget for special effects. <br \/>","name":"October's book - Lucifer's Hammer by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle","group":{"id":1547173,"name":"Drinks and Doom (a post apocalyptic book club)","join_mode":"open","urlname":"apocalypse"}},{"id":"15129465","distance":2.2603659629821777,"time":1287964800000,"trending_rank":45,"status":"upcoming","yes_rsvp_count":9,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/AKPsi-BAAC\/calendar\/15129465\/","maybe_rsvp_count":3,"description":"Hello Fellow AKPsi BAAC Brothers!<br \/><br \/><br \/>Weare now holding the meeting at 5pm on 10\/24 (Sunday), in Fremont, at<br \/>Premier Pizza and Pasta.

Each month a new ingredient will be presented, and all participants will bake their interpretation of the ingredient in cupcake fashion. All bakers will meetup on the last Monday of each month where the live challenge will begin. Friends, family, and other contestants will take part in the taste testing as well as voting for the winner. By the end of the evening a winner will be chosen and random prizes will be awarded to the winner. The goal is to gather as many cupcake lovers as possible together to expand their cupcakes horizons, their baking skills, and ultimately have a great time.

We know that every living being has energy within and around the body to be alive. This energy is called Chi (vital energy) and it is vital for the physical body to exist. The physical body usually has problems because the energy does not flow properly. By stimulating the energy to flow properly as it is supposed to, the natural ability of the body to heal itself will be able to function again, and the physical body will recover. Reiki healing is able not only to stimulate the energy to flow properly but also to cleanse the energy within and around the body to speed up the healing process. <br \/>","name":"1h Private Session to pamper yourself with Reiki Tummo Healing Energy","group":{"id":1372234,"name":"Reiki Tummo (Kundalini) and Heart-Centered Meditation","join_mode":"open","urlname":"Reiki-Tummo-SF"}},{"trending_rank":94,"status":"upcoming","maybe_rsvp_count":0,"photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/5\/global_13837333.jpeg","id":"15168653","distance":2.5414319038391113,"time":1288059300000,"yes_rsvp_count":4,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/San-Francisco-Qi-Dragon\/calendar\/15168653\/","description":"<b>Monday Night Qigong for Health<\/b>  (Beginners are welcome)<br \/><br \/>Mondays 7:15pm-8:45pm<br \/><br \/>1663 Mission Street, Back Mezzanine, entrance on Plum Steet (next to Discount Builders off Duboce St), Door Code 352<br \/>$10 per class, there will be a donation box on site<br \/>Led by Liping Zhu or senior student<br \/><br \/>This class is a good opportunity for practicing the 3 Dynamic Qigong and Nourishing Qi meditation in a group setting.

We invite you to join us to celebrate a quarter century Community advocacy and to especially thank those whose efforts have helped educate and inspire and support us in the past year.   It's not too late to RSVP - let us know that you will be joining us!  <br \/><br \/>The event will be held at Microsoft’s San Francisco office, 835 Market Street, Suite 700.  A buffet dinner catered by Miraglia will be served starting at 6:15pm and we will begin the formal meeting between 7:00-7:15pm to discuss this year's elections for our Board of Directors and begin introducing our VIP guests. <br \/><br \/>In 2010 BAADD has continued to host user group meetings at no cost to attendees.  This is possible due to the generous donations from our Sponsors and the work of your volunteer board who coordinate the sponsorship relations that help generate operating cash, recruit presenters, organize meetings rooms and meals and, last but not least, great raffle prizes.  In turn we ask for your support by becoming a BAADD member, or renewing your membership in this organization, and joining us on October 26th.   <br \/><br \/>Your participation helps keep this organization healthy and vibrant.  And more than simply allowing you to attend the Annual Meeting at no cost, membership provides you with access to Job Leads information, entitles you to voting rights within the organization, enables you to run for office on the Board of Directors and allows you to take advantage of special offers and opportunities provided by our Sponsors and benefactors. <br \/><br \/>The Annual Meeting offers a relaxed environment with plenty of time to mingle, converse and get to know your fellow developers while sharing a table and maybe a glass of wine. At this event you will meet people and presenters from user group meetings that you may not have been able to attend in the past year, as well as  those whose presentations you enjoyed, and you will have a chance to rub elbows with leaders in the developer community.   <br \/><br \/>This extended network of professional peers is a virtual security blanket for your career.  It is our mission at BAADD to provide our members with access to that network through as many avenues as possible, and the Annual Meeting is one of the best opportunities you'll find. <br \/><br \/>This year we have one open seat on the Board of Directors, and two seats up for re-election. We welcome and encourage members both new and old to throw their hats in the ring along with any incumbents for these volunteer positions. Take the opportunity to have a say in the governance of the organization and its future direction!  No prior experience is required - just a current BAADD membership and a desire to give back to the community.

While she convalesces under armed guard, journalist Mikael Blomkvist works to unravel the decades-old coverup surrounding the man who shot Salander: her father, Alexander Zalachenko, a Soviet intelligence defector and longtime secret asset to Säpo, Sweden's security police. Estranged throughout Fire, Blomkvist and Salander communicate primarily online, but their lack of physical interaction in no way diminishes the intensity of their unconventional relationship. Though Larsson (1954–2004) tends toward narrative excess, his was an undeniably powerful voice in crime fiction that will be sorely missed. 500,000 first printing.

Traditionally the meeting time was 7:00, but I won't be there until 7:30. After climbing a bunch of my friends head to the Phoenix for food and beer. All are welcome to join!<br \/><br \/>All levels are welcome! New climbers will need to take a belay safety class, offered through Mission Cliffs.  The belay safety class starts at 7:30 pm and it's recommended that you show up a bit earlier to get a better chance of snagging a spot (at least 15 min prior). There's also an earlier class at 6pm.<br \/><br \/>For all other levels, you will need to get a belay card if you don't have one. Just tell the person at the counter you need a belay card when you purchase your day pass. You will be required to go through a belay safety check to get the belay card.  <br \/><br \/><b>What to expect:<\/b><br \/>This Meetup is designed to bring local climbers together, and to provide an easy way for people to find climbing partners. We'll meet, break into partners to climb, then climb until ???. After climbing, some of us will go out for food and a beer.<br \/><br \/>Everyone in the Meetup is supportive, and everyone is happy to climb with new climbers, but but this meetup is not an instructional course. You need to know how to belay safely to climb.  If you don't know how to belay, or are unsure of your belay skills, you should take the belay class offered by the gym.<br \/><br \/>Day pass after 3pm is $18. <br \/>Equipment rental (shoes\/harness\/belay device) is $5.<br \/>Belay safety class is $28 (includes a day pass and rentals too!). <br \/><br \/><br \/><b>NEW MEETING POINT!!<\/b><br \/>We will meet by the big glass windows\/door in the back corner of the gym.

Finally this will be one of kind &amp; official debut of our weekly meetup event yay!!:) <i><b>Special thanks to Charith &amp; Brian, who first introduced me to the event &amp; also inspired me in many ways…<\/b><\/i> I am sure a number of you already heard about this before by now. SoCha the cafe is a short name for South of Chavez and is in the Mission SF. This venue is hosting a live classical music concert by the Classical Revolution led by Charith Premawardhana every Wednesday evening from 8 until close to 11. Of course you are not obligated to stay until the end. Please try the link <b>Classical Revolution<\/b>, and find out who they are. I feel that my words aren’t adequate enough to describe this talented passionate classical musician group. Bottom line: I luuu…vit period!:) It’s free and donation’s suggested. The venue also offers great selection of food, goodies, and drinks, and they are decently priced too. Come around 8 to be seated within good proximity to the music.  Unfortunately(?)There's <i><b>no public program posting<\/b><\/i> for this event ahead of time. You just come &amp; find out what's on the menu for the evening! Generally I like the idea of being surprised… believe it or not it has been so haha!:)   <br \/><br \/>Well, I’ve been enjoying a lot since the ambience intertwined with live classical music there helps me decompress from work\/study stress, and it’s perfect time for mid-week respite, which I feel I deserve very much. Hope it will do more or less the same benefit to you if you are like me.   <br \/>So, please feel free to join me &amp; other classical music fellas for this weekly schmooze time @ the SoCha’s.    <br \/><br \/>Thanks &amp; hope to see you there!!    <br \/><br \/>Here are some excerpts from our members:   <br \/><br \/>“The noise level's very reasonable. Usually the serious listeners are on one end of cafe near the performers, and other's in the back cave, mainly on their laptops. It's a much less intense atmosphere than their Sunday night gigs at the Revolution”   <br \/><br \/>“Hi Charith, Wow, that was a great experience!:) You're right... very hip &amp; great vibes. I sort of had a short stay yesterday. And i was told that yesterday was kind of unusual set-up, but i didn't mind that at all! Had a wonderful time listening to that young bassoonist. I did see you coming around, but didn't get to talk to you. You seem like one of those creative genii! I think i will probably go back there next Wed for a short study break. See you around and thanks for putting together the program like this.”   <br \/><br \/>“There’s been much chatter about Classical Revolution in our group of late. Just a reminder that each Wed.(tonight!) CR’s at my favorite internet café in the City, SoCha (in outer Mission District) from 8:00—to 10:30. It’s free. I’m usually there, always enjoy it. It’s a very hip way to get a weeknight chamber music fix. They’re also at the Revolution Café each Sunday night, but it’s very crowded, groupie-ish scene. I find it much less pleasant than their Socha gigs.   <br \/>I usually try to arrive a little early, get a table near the music…”   <br \/><br \/>&quot;Live chamber music for the people -- Almost always free of charge except for special events -- Live classical music without the pretension.

Exploring the SDK – apress ), Steve Kochan (Programming Objective- C 2.0 – Addison WesleyPress) Dan Pilone (Head First iPhone Development- A Learners Guide to Creating Objective- Applications for the iPhone – O’Reilly Press)  Jonathon Manning and Paris  Butterfield-Addison (iPhone and iPad Game Development for Dummies – Wiley Press) and Matt Campbell (How to Make an iPhone App- Mobile App Mastery)<br \/><br \/>Developers only include trainers Eddie Marks and James Anthony (co-founders inedible Software), Nathan Eror (founder, Free Time Studios) Ben Sgro (senior software engineer and development manager Elephant Ventures) , Charles Gamble (founder, Percula Software) and Oz Michaeli (co-founder, Spiralstormgames.com)<br \/><br \/>Many of our instructors have apps in the top ten and real world experience in how to market apps in the app store  that they share with the developers in the workshop<br \/><br \/><b>Syllabus<\/b><br \/>You'll start by coding a utility application, and I'll give you an overview of the steps and tools involved and the capabilities of Xcode and the SDK We start by looking at the templates that come with Xcode that can get you up and running quickly. You’ll create a simple application Goodbye Hello World using the View based application template and the partial curl transition. I'll show you how to use tab views as well.  I'll get more into Xocde and how to customize it. We’ll go through Objective C basics: classes, objects, message syntax, properties, dot notation, I’ll explain the SDK and the basic architecture of an iPhone application including the various design patterns used in the SDK that you will need to know         <br \/>Model-View-Controller (MVC)<br \/>Delegation<br \/>Target-Action<br \/>Block Objects<br \/>Managed Memory Model<br \/><br \/>Then we’ll take a look at how iOS 4 works; How your application is launched, how it runs at runtime, and how it needs to behave in the multitasking world of iOS 4.<br \/><br \/>Then I’ll take you through the real world development process of developing a utility application. We’ll start by using Interface Builder to design the user interface.  You’ll work with the basic UIKit classes and view controllers and views. You will use labels, images, buttons and button-like controls, gesture recognizers, and text fields. You’ll work with the notification system and use Block objects to respond to notifications. You'll  scroll the view using core animation when the keyboard blocks a text field. You’ll discover outlets and target-action and how to work with properties.  You’ll also save some data to user preferences. Later you’ll take that data and save it using Core Data. You’ll use a Web view to display information and even have it dial a phone number you display for you. Then you’ll add sound, more animation using Core Animation, and even access to the user's iPod library to allow them to listen to their own music. During the process I’ll show you how to use the debugger to deal with errors and use breakpoints to actually see what’s going on as your application executes.<br \/><br \/>Then we go through the process of provisioning your application to run on the iPhone: ad hoc provisioning so you can have people beta test your app, and finally getting it ready for the store and the process of submitting to the store and how to avoid getting it rejected.<br \/><br \/>With all this under your belt, you’ll go to work on an industrial strength application. I’ll take you through the design process and you’ll create a user interface and application design. You’ll learn all about Table views and how to make them work the way you want, including how to customize Table view cells. You’ll save the state of an application and add your application’s user preferences to the Settings application. You’ll also handle the situation under iOS 4, of the user changing preferences while your app is in background. You’ll work with content both in the application bundle and download content from the web to use in your application. You’ll work more Web views and how to use your own content, and even access web pages without leaving your application. We’ll use the file system and create and restore files and enter the magical world of property lists. Since your application will be multiple pages, you’ll use a Table view to navigate the pages and how navigation controllers work. <br \/><br \/>Finally you’ll dig deeply into the crown jewels of the iPhone: mapping and location services. You’ll display maps, create custom annotations, and even drag annotations and change their coordinates and what they display. You’ll use reverse geocoding to create addresses from coordinates and then zoom the map to display the regions on a map. You’ll learn all about core location and how it works including the services available to reduce battery drain, and you’ll  keep your application running in background and display local notifications to the user about location changes, even when your application is running in background. <br \/><br \/>About the iPhone Boot Camp<br \/>The iPhone Boot camp is the leading training workshop for professional iPhone development. We employ top level developer-trainers to teach iPhone development and related iPhone development tools, such as Cocoa, Objective C and Open GL ES.  To date we have trained in six cities in two countries over 100 developers who have developed dozens of apps in the app store, from indpendent developer to Fortune 500 companies, including IBM, AOL, genentech, SRI, Thomson Reuter, AP, theknot.com, Crate and Barrel, Shure, HBSC,etc.<br \/><br \/>What should I bring with me?<br \/>An Intel Macintosh laptop computer.<br \/>XCode and the iPhone SDK installed on your Macintosh laptop <br \/>An iPhone or iPod Touch, if you have one (optional) <br \/>Basic programming knowledge, including object-oriented programming experience, such as Java,, NET, C,  Visual Studio<br \/>Familiarity with the Mac<br \/><br \/>Who should attend?<br \/>Experienced programmers interested in iPhone application development<br \/>People new to Mac development and iPhone development<br \/><br \/>Why take a workshop when I can read books, attend a lecture watch videos and webinars?<br \/>Most people, even those with extensive experience in programming, find the SDK difficult to master. Books and video are great to prepare for a workshop but there  is sitll no substitute for a small hands on workshop with other developer, where you can ask questions to an experienced instructor looking over your shoulder as you go through the episodes step by step. Basically it saves you month of time and money.<br \/><br \/>Our Alumni Network for Work<br \/>We don't just offer training. We are also iPhone developers ourselves, as are our alumni. We have an online alumni network where the members post jobs, requests for proposals and form partnerships.<br \/>To find out more about the iPhone Boot Camp, including videos, a detailed syllabus, links to our local meetup groups and detailed info on how to prepare for the workshop go to our main site iPhoneBootCampNYC<br \/><br \/>Registration for the next San Francisco iPhone Boot Camp is now open at early bird rate.

Portrayed without feet because they have lost their connection to the earth, they are so filled with love, jealousy or rage that they won't go peacefully into the night.  Japanese believe ghosts are people who have died with an unpaid on  — “debt” or “obligation.” If not repaid, the debt is passed down for generations, growing with each one like a snowball into an avalanche. Whole families, villages, countries can live under the dark cloud of an on. By then, nobody knows how to fix it. <br \/><br \/>BUT – storytellers can help people remember what happened in the past. Love stories soften our hearts. Tales of wonder awaken awe in the world around us.

I hope you can all make it despite it only being one week away. <br \/><br \/>We were once again lucky enough to secure the meeting space in the awesome Engine Yard offices. The time will be the same as previous meetups: 7-9 (give or take a few minutes).<br \/><br \/>The schedule will be as follows:<br \/><br \/>7:15 - 7:30 <br \/><b>Riak Basics<\/b><br \/>As we did last meeting, we will endeavor to answer any and all basic Riak questions.

So, here is what we thought we would do:<br \/><br \/>Many of the questions around Riak are related to use cases and whether or not Riak is suitable for them. And, I suspect, many of you are attending the Riak meetups to determine this very thing. Here is what we thought would be great. Submit your use case in advance to me and we will cover as many as possible (time permitting). <br \/><br \/>If you would like to have your use case reviewed, send an email to <i>mark@basho.com<\/i> with the subject &quot;Use Case Review&quot; and the following info:<br \/><br \/><ul><br \/><li>Describe what your application does<br \/><li>Describe how your data breaks down into logical groups (e.g., Users, Comments, Postings, etc.)<br \/><li>Describe how your data relates to itself (e.g., Users write posts and comment on posts)<br \/><li>Describe the behavior of the relationship over time (e.g., A user writes posts once a day, comments are added to posts very frequently)<br \/><\/ul><br \/><br \/>This should be fun.

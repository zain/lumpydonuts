29-30 (sign up here: http:\/\/engineering.twitter.com\/2010\/05\/annotations-hackfest.html) \r\n\r\n\"We at Twitter are pretty excited about Annotations, mostly because we know developers will do incredibly creative things with them. What, exactly? We don't know yet, but we'll get an idea May 29-30, when we hold our annotations hackfest. Developers will come to our newly opened office and build apps for about 24 intense hours, and then have them judged by an extraordinary panel of early-stage startup investors, including Paul Graham of Y Combinator and Ron Conway of SV Angel.\r\n\r\nWe'll let people into the Twitter office (795 Folsom St, 3rd floor) at 1PM Saturday 5\/29, and hacking will continue from then until around 4PM Sunday 5\/30. Judging will start shortly after, and each presenting group will get 4 minutes to demo, followed by a 4-minute Q&A. You'll need to bring your own laptop, but wifi, food, and beverages will all be provided. There will be some pretty cool surprises along the way, too.\r\n\r\nThis is a free event, with attendees limited to around 50. Please RSVP with the form below.\"\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/engineering.twitter.com\/2010\/05\/annotations-hackfest.html\r\n\r\nNote: Not in San Francisco? No Problem.

it.\r\n\r\ncoming up, we’re meeting at tennessee valley for a little outdoor jewish adventure (no, that is not a joke). we’ll find some ways to access shabbat (no experience required) and get some fresh air.  perfect for kids or grownups that get antsy trying to connect within four walls. nita says: there are some good shabbat times to be had and they’re ours for the taking.\r\n\r\nmost likely we’ll walk 1.7 mostly flat, easy miles out to the lovely beach, picnic there, and then return.  there may be some pauses or detours to special spots along the way to focus on jewish stuff.  we haven’t decided on our exact adventure plan yet but whatever we do, it’ll be jogging-stroller-accessible and probably doable with a standard stroller, so don’t worry!\r\n\r\nplease note: we love your dogs as much as we love you but unfortunately, due to nps regulations, they’re not invited on our little hike.\r\n\r\nfinally, we’ve summoned all our special connections to ensure there will be bright sun and no wind or fog but we haven’t received a commitment on that, so please remember to dress for outdoor success: layers are key, including (most importantly) wind blocking shells for all just in case the air is having a party at the beach while we have ours. sunscreen, sunhats, and all that stuff your mom always told you to bring is probably a good idea, too.\r\n\r\nRSVP:

Attempted disruption may irritate you, but do not lose your temper. Stay above the bull-baiting, and if feeling intimidated or extremely angry, ask for intervention (i.e. blocking) from other protesters. Any uncontrolled behavior  will harm the protest, tarnish our collective reputation, and possibly get you arrested for disorderly conduct.\r\nRespect and cooperate with police officers - Even if you disagree with police directions, be respectful and polite. San Francisco police officers are there for everyone's safety, and have been very supportive of us exercising our First Amendment rights — in large part because we have been so easy to work with. Preserve that relationship. If they tell you to stay on the opposite side of the street, stay on the opposite side of the street.\r\nMake your signs legible from a distance - Big fonts, preferably in one color. Keep the message direct & short. Avoid using any slang terminology. You're attempting to get a message across to the general public about a dangerous oil spill.
